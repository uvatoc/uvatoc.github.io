        <p>Exam 1 will be in class on Thursday, 2 March.</p>
<p>It will cover material from Classes 1 – 9, Problem Sets 1
– 4 (including the provided comments), Quizzes 1 – 4, and
Chapter 1 – 5 of the TCS Book. Nearly everything on the exam
will have been covered in at least three of these places (e.g., in
class, on a problem set, and in the textbook; or in multiple classes,
the textbook, and a quiz).</p>
<p>As a reminder from the syllabus, you may prepare a <strong>one-page
(letter-size, two-sided) reference sheet for use during the exam</strong>,
but all other resources are forbidden (no internet, textbook, other
humans, magnification instruments, etc.). We expect that students will
benefit from thinking about what to put on your reference sheet in
preparing for the exam, and you may work with anyone you want
(including other students in the class) to prepare your reference
sheets together.</p>
<center>
<p><a href="/docs/exam1practice.pdf">Exam 1 Practice Problems</a></p>
</center>
<p>The problems in the PDF linked above should give you an idea what to
expect on the Exam — problems 1 – 9 are essentially an
example of a full Exam 1 (from the Fall 2019 course, but with a few
edits to some questions and whitespace removed), so similar in length
to what you should expect for the exam on March 2. If you want to see
the original exam that was given to students in 2019 (which is closer
in content and structure to this semester&rsquo;s course than the
pandemic-adjusted offerings since then), you are welcome to look at
that also:
<a href="https://uvatoc.github.io/f19/exam1comments/">https://uvatoc.github.io/f19/exam1comments/</a>.</p>
<p>The 2019 exam does not cover some of the topics we have covered for
this Exam, so we have also provided some additional practice problems
after the practice exam.</p>
<p>We will post solutions and comments for some of these problems (and
are happy to answer any questions you have about them), but encourage
you to first try them on your own, then in discussion with other
students if possible, before looking at the solutions (hopefully to
verify your own answer is correct, and to see other approaches). We
emphasize, though, that you are not expected to solve all of these
problems and there is no submission expected for these. The problems
are provided to give you problems to practice and check your
understanding in preparing for the exam. If you are able to solve
these problems, you should be confident that you&rsquo;ll be able to do well
on the exam.</p>

<p>Quiz 4 is in GradeScope (after noon today) and due Wednesday, 9:59pm. As posted in discord, the collaboration policy for the quizzes has changed (including for this quiz): From now on, you are permitted to use resources for quizzes, but not to discuss the problems with other people. You may use your notes, the course textbook, posted class slides/videos, and any other materials you want while you take the quiz. It is fine to look at the quiz questions, and then to consult these resources before submitting your answers.</p>

<p>As was pointed out to me by an intrepid student after class, what I
said about { OR, NOT } being not universal since we included AND in
our AON Circuits is badly wrong! One easy way to see this is we know
we can convert between { AND, NOT } and { OR, NOT } using De Morgan&rsquo;s
laws, so we can construct AND from { OR, NOT }. Although it seems
disturbing that we are focusing on { AND, OR, NOT }, and it is not a
minimal universal gate set, we already knew this from showing that {
NAND } is univeral (and obviously, we can build NAND with just { AND,
NOT }).</p>

        <p>As discussed in <a href="/class5">Class 5</a>, there was a problem on Quiz 2 that
both the professors got wrong probably more than once.</p>
<p>Although it was meant to be a fairly straightforward multiple choice
question, it illustrates how tricky it is to think about the
subtleties of simple definitions on binary relations and the
importance of precise definitions.</p>
<p>The question, as asked on Quiz 2 is below:</p>
<p><strong>Question 2: Notions of Relations</strong></p>
<p>Which of the following are true statements for <em>all</em> sets \(X\) and \(Y\)? Choose all that are correct:</p>
<ol>
<li>If there is a bijection between sets \(X,Y\), then there is an injective \((\le 1\) in) function (\(\le 1 \) out) from \(X\) to \(Y\).</li>
<li>If there is a partial function from \(X\) to \(Y\), then there is surjective mapping \((\ge 1\) in) from \(Y\) to \(X\).</li>
<li>There is a total (\( \ge 1\) out) function from \(Y\) to \(X\) if and only if there is a surjective mapping from \(X\) to \(Y\).</li>
<li>If there is a surjective total function from \(X\) to \(Y\), then there is an injective mapping from \(X\) to \(Y\).</li>
</ol>
<p>In class, we decided that choice 1 was definitely correct, but there
was some doubt on the other three choices and confusion about the
meaning of <em>mapping</em> which we didn&rsquo;t define (the TCS book uses the
term mapping frequently, but does not formally define it; the <a href="https://uvacs2102.github.io/docs/mcs.pdf">MCS
(cs2102) book</a>, uses
&ldquo;Mapping Rules&rdquo; to talk about different kinds of binary relations;
according to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_(mathematics)">wikipedia</a>, mapping
usually means &ldquo;total function&rdquo;, and &ldquo;partial map&rdquo; is used ot mean
&ldquo;partial function&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Assuming &ldquo;mapping&rdquo; means &ldquo;total function&rdquo;, we believe statements 2, 3,
and 4 are all false.</p>
<p>If &ldquo;mapping&rdquo; means &ldquo;binary relation&rdquo; (which does not add any
constraints), then statements 2 and 4 are true, and statement 3 is
false.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll leave it as a <span class="challenge">challenge problem</span>
for students to come up with some other non-crazy interpretation of
&ldquo;mapping&rdquo; that would make any other combination of these statements
true. (By &ldquo;non-crazy&rdquo;, we mean it has to be a definition that makes at
least some sense in a general context, not being specifically
contrived to have different meanings based on the question specifics.)</p>
<p>The way challenge problems work is the first student to provide a
solution the professors this is interesting and valuable enough in
response to the challenge will receive bonus points (in an amount that
it totally at our discretion, but might be as much as a full problem
set or more); once a solution has been accepted, the challenge isn&rsquo;t
necessarily closed, but for a subsequent solution to also receive a
bonus it would have to offer substantial value beyond the first
accepted solution.</p>
