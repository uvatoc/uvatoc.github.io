      <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>Our plan for how to use the full class meeting times has adapted from
our original plan - we&rsquo;ll provide more justification for the change
below, but the plan now is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Monday classes will be for covering examples, providing context, and
answering student questions about the current week&rsquo;s content,
designed to help students understand the materials you will be
assessed on during your cohort meetings. These will be before any of
that week&rsquo;s assessed cohort meetings, so all students will have the
chance to benefit from these before your assessed cohort meetings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wednesday classes will not cover anything directly related to the
current week&rsquo;s content (since this seems unfair to students who have
their assessed cohort meetings on that material on Mondays or
Tuesdays), but instead will include discussion of the previous
week&rsquo;s problems (so we may discuss problems from week 1 on September
8) and excursions into topics we think are interesting and
enlightening, and that have some connection to the course content,
but that we don&rsquo;t expect would provide any help for the specific
cohort problems you are being assessed on that week.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All the full class meetings are still strictly optional, and we will
not be introducing any new material that you will be assessed on
during these meetings. We will also be live streaming and recording
them - sorry we have had troubles getting decent video and audio for
previous classes. We are working with UVA classroom support to find
the best way to prevent this in the future.</p>
<p>We apologize for any initial confusion about this, but we&rsquo;ve
come to the realization that the plan we had on the syllabus doesn&rsquo;t
make much sense. We worked out the cohort structure during our online
semesters, and the response from the past students was so
overwhelmingly positive that we wanted to figure out how to make it
work for this semester as well. There are some non-trivial adaptations
required to do this, and we&rsquo;re still figuring some of that out. The
most substantial change for this semester is going to be how to best
use our lecture time.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to just use lecture time to teach content like we did
pre-pandemic, since we don&rsquo;t want there to be any pressure on students
who might feel sick, have risk profiles that make them uncomfortable
in high density indoor settings, or otherwise be at risk to come to
class. We also think the video materials we&rsquo;ve produced over the past
year are quite good and cover the course content better than we would
in new live lectures (while providing students with a lot more
flexibility how and when to watch them).</p>
<p>Upon reflection, however, our original plan of essentially duplicating
the Monday classes on Wednesdays, and expecting students in
Monday-Wednesday cohorts to show up on Mondays, and others to show up
on Wednesdays, doesn&rsquo;t seem fair to students or make the best use of
class time. You&rsquo;re paying tuition for a class that is supposed to have
two full class meetings a week, so despite what we said Wednesday
about the expected financial return from learning CS theory, its not
fair to design the class around assuming you would only have one class
a week. But, it also seems like it would be frustrating to students in
the Monday-Tuesday cohorts if we cover materials relevant to the
cohort problems on which they were already assessed in Wednesday
classes. We hope the new plan solves this - it allows everyone in the
class to have a full class meeting that is designed to help on
understanding the content you&rsquo;ll be assessed on in that week&rsquo;s cohort
meeting, and hopefully will allow us to cover a lot of interesting and
worthwhile material in the Wednesday classes.</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t make any promises about this model being in effect until,
say, October 1, but will continue to adapt what we do in the full
class meetings as the semester progresses. The one main risk in this,
though, is if we don&rsquo;t hear from students who are not coming to
classes but would if we were doing something else about why they are
not coming and how to make classes more worthwhile, we are likely to
adapt mostly based on what we hear from the students who do come to
the classes.</p>
<p>Thanks for your patience as we develop this new model, and do let
please us know any suggestions or ideas you have.</p>

<p>There should also be a recording available, but unfortunately with
barely audible sound. Sorry for the technical problems with zoom and
recording setup, we are working on getting this to work better and
getting help from the classrooms support before the next class to
hopefully have better results for this for future classes.</p>

        <h2 id="first-class-meeting">First Class Meeting</h2>
<p>Our first scheduled class is Wednesday, 25 August, 3:30-4:45pm in
Maury Hall 209 (weather permitting, we will also use the Ampitheater
space outside Maury).</p>
<p>For this optional first class meeting, we will have an open &ldquo;meet and
greet&rdquo; with an opportunity to ask any questions you would like of the
course instructors, and an opportunity for students who wish to form
their own cohorts (details below) to do so. There won&rsquo;t be any lecture
or course content introduced, or need to crowd into the classroom.
Please read the <a href="/syllabus">Syllabus</a> to understand how the class will
be run and what we mean by &ldquo;cohorts&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="cohort-scheduling">Cohort Scheduling</h2>
<p>There will be a form posted tomorrow (Wednesday, 25 August) for
students to submit cohort scheduling preferences. Everyone will need
to do this by <strong>Wednesday at 4:59pm</strong> in order for us to assign and
schedule the cohorts. You can submit the form during the scheduled
class time tomorrow, and everyone in the class should be able to
submit the form by the end of this time.</p>
<p>If you would like to form your own cohort, you may attempt to do so
during the class time Wednesday. Forming your own cohort is totally
optional, but Wednesday&rsquo;s class meeting is your only opportunity to
request a cohort group. After 4:45pm on Wednesday, we will be
assigning all students who have not successfully formed their own
cohorts to cohorts based on the scheduling information you submitted.</p>
<p>In order to successfully form a cohort, you would need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Form a group of exactly six students (all of whom are enrolled in cs3102).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify a time that works for everyone for their prep meetings, and
a set of possible times for your assessed cohort meetings. For your
cohort to be accepted, we need to be able to match your available
times with a time when there is a Cohort Leader (TA) available. So, it
is to your advantage to list as many times as possible that work for
everyone in your cohort.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Come to one of us (Nathan or Dave) during the class time Wednesday
with a list on paper of their names and email IDs, the times for their
prep meeting, and possible times for assessed cohort meetings. You
will need to also submit this in a web form so we have it
electronically, and what they submit there must match what is on the
paper.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Convince us that the proposed cohort satisfies our diversity
criteria. We do not have a formal specification of what is
satisfactory, but at a minimum a cohort cannot include more than 3
people who went to the same high school. In forming your cohort you
should think about what will make it a good learning community.  You
will be able to meet other students in the class during the class time
tomorrow, and may be able to find a group you want to form a cohort
with.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We will do our best to keep students who successfully do all of this
by the end of the class time Wednesday in their requested cohort, but
cannot promise this since it may be necessary to adjust things because
of TA schedules and other constraints.</p>
<p>Assessed cohort meetings will start (at the earliest) on Tuesday, 31
August, so students scheduled in Tuesday cohorts will have preparation
Cohort Meetings on Saturday or Sunday (28 or 29 August), and will need
to be ready with the <a href="/week1">Week 1</a> problems by their cohort meeting
on 31 August. (Other students will have more time, depending on when
your assessed cohort meeting is scheduled.)</p>

        <p>[Updated 18 August 2021]</p>
<p>The cs3102 course will be offered in Fall 2021, co-taught by <a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~njb2b/">Nathan Brunelle</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/evans/">David Evans</a>.</p>
<p>Class meetings will be Mondays and Wednesday, 3:30pm - 4:45pm in Maury
Hall 209. We will be sending out an email next week with details on
the in-person class meetings, but they are being planned in a way that
prioritizes safety and comfort while offering an in-person class
experience.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be putting more information here about the course as the start
of the semester approaches.</p>
<p>For now, you can see what the course was like last year from the
<a href="/f20">archived course website</a> (including the syllabus from the Fall 2020
course: <a href="https://uvatoc.github.io/f20/syllabus/">Fall 2020
Syllabus</a>). You can also see
the <a href="https://uvatoc.github.io/f19/">Fall 2019</a> course, which was the
previous (pre-Covid) version of the course. The design of the Fall
2021 course is not set yet, but it will most likely be a combination
of aspects of the previous (lockdown) semesters, and what we did for
the last in-person version (Fall 2019).</p>
