        <p>The Self-Assessment Midterm is posted here: <a href="/ps/midterm.pdf">midterm.pdf</a></p>

<p>This self-assessment midterm is intended to help prepare you to do
well on the final by giving you experience taking an exam, but without
any grade pressure or logistical challenges.</p>

<p>This exam will not be graded, but you do need to upload an image of
your exam by <strong>2:59pm Wednesday, 13 October</strong>. You are encouraged to
print out the exam to do on paper, and take it under realistic exam
conditions. The exam is designed for a 75-minute class period, so you
should not spend longer than that to complete it and should work on
the exam alone, without using any resources other than the one-page
reference sheet you prepare (see below).</p>

<p>When you have finished the exam, take pictures of your exam for the
upload. It is not necessary to typeset your exam (and doing the exam
on paper better simulates what you will do for the final). We will
look at the uploaded exams to get a sense of how the class is doing,
and to confirm that you&rsquo;ve put effort into doing the exam, but will
not be grading these on performance.</p>

<p>The exam covers material from Weeks 1&ndash;5 of the course, including the
assigned reading and video materials. Most of the questions on the
exam will cover topics that have been covered in the assigned cohort
problems.</p>

<p><strong>Reference Sheet.</strong> You should prepare a one-page (letter-size,
two-sided) reference sheet for use during the exam, but all other
resources are forbidden (no internet, textbook, other humans,
magnification instruments, etc.). We expect that students will benefit
from thinking about what to put on your reference sheet in preparing
for the exam, and you may work with anyone you want (including your
cohort-mates and other students in the class) to prepare a reference
sheets together. For the Final Exam, you will also be able to use a
reference sheet you prepare.</p>

        <p>Thanks to Calvin Kuo for finding the original source of the Poincaré quote.</p>

<p><a href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k214846v/f711.item"><em>La Revue politique et littéraire</em></a> (page 708), 1904. <a href="/docs/poincare-essay.pdf">PDF</a></p>

<p>Below is a translation, done mostly by Google translate, but with corrections by <a href="https://sdg.cs.virginia.edu/authors/anh-nguyen-tuong/">Anh Nguyen Tuong</a>.</p>

<div class="longquote">

_Mr. Henry Poincare, from the Academy of Sciences, member of the Bureau des Longitudes, professor at the Sorbonne, chief mining engineer, author of nearly three hundred original papers which have renowned by their contribution of discoveries and insights, the mathematical physics and celestial mechanics, emits on the political activity of scientists this opinion of good sense._

It is clear that scholars, like all citizens, must take an interest in the affairs of their country. As soon as they have reason to think that their intervention can usefully serve the interests of the nation, they must sacrifice everything to this duty.

Do they have any special obligations in this regard which are not incumbent on other citizens? Do they owe the public more than others? Yes, if they can be more useful to society; and they can be more useful to society if their voice is more likely to be heard. But are their reasons for it to be? The language of passion is the only one that the crowd understands and this language is not theirs.

You ask me whether it is appropriate for them to enter Parliament and take part in power, and whether political activity is likely to thwart or promote their vocation. The answer is easy, politics is today a profession which absorbs the whole person; a scientist who wants to devote themself to it will have to sacrifice their vocation; if they want to be really useful to the country, they must give half to the affairs of their electors; they will no longer have anything left for Science. There is indeed M. Berthelot, but M. Berthelot is irremovable. The irremovable ones are deleteted and there is no likelihood that they will ever be reinstated. Perhaps the representation of minorities with the Spanish system of voting would solve the problem and reopen the Parliament to men who want to be more than politicians.

It would therefore be unfortunate for all scholars to aspire to Parliament, because then there would be no scientists. Whether we sacrifice from time to time someone among us, more apt to make themself understood by crowds or assemblies, we can resign ourselves to it, or even rejoice, not only for the country, but for the science itself, because after all, it has to have someone to defend its interests.

But most of them should be confined to newspaper and magazine articles. I doubt their voices will be heard, amid the din of daily struggles.

Finally, you ask me if the learned politicians should fight or support the policy of the ministerial bloc? Ah! for once, I recuse myself; each of them will have to vote according to their conscience; I guess not everyone will think about this the same way, and I couldn't really complain. If there are scientists in politics, there must be some in all parties, and indeed, it is essential that there always be some on the side in power. Science needs money, and the people in power, those who have the money, must not be able to say to themselves, science is the enemy.

<p>The quote I used on the last slide is (translated) from <em>La Revue Bleue</em> (<em>Revue politique et littéraire</em>) 1904:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, this time I have to excuse myself; everybody will have to choose according to his conscience. I think that not everybody will cast the same vote, and I see no reason to complain about this. If scientists take part in politics, they should take part in all parties, and it is indeed necessary that they be present in the strongest party. Science needs money, and it should not be such that the people with power can say, science, that is the enemy.</p>

original, that is worth at least a portable whiteboard.)</p>

<p>One important correction from the class: I was spectacularly wrong
about Jay-Z not being &ldquo;really really rich&rdquo;. I was just thinking about
his music income, and even spectacularly successful musicians usually
capture such a small fraction of the value that they create that very
few are &ldquo;really really rich&rdquo;. For purposes of this discussion, I&rsquo;ll
define &ldquo;really really rich&rdquo; as having net worth over $1B, and &ldquo;really
rich&rdquo; as having net worth over $100M. Whether &ldquo;really really rich&rdquo;
people have a higher quality of life than &ldquo;really rich&rdquo; people or even
&ldquo;comfortably rich&rdquo; people, is open to much debate, but for purposes of
dropping $.5M on an old book, it makes a difference if you are &ldquo;really
really rich&rdquo; or just &ldquo;really rich&rdquo;.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.therichest.com/top-lists/top-100-richest-musicians"><em>Top 100 Richest
Musicians</em></a>,
even spectacularly successful muscians like Eminem, Tim McGraw, Stevie
Nicks, Eddie Vedder, and Peter Gabriel don&rsquo;t exceed the &ldquo;really rich&rdquo;
threshold. But, Jay-Z is a billionaire! (Number 1 on this list, along
with two other billionaire &ldquo;musicians&rdquo;, Paul McCartney and Andrew
Lloyd Webber). He&rsquo;s a billionaire because he leveraged his musical
success to be a successful entrepreneur &mdash; building a music streaming
company, Tidal, which was sold to Square (for around $300M), a
champagne brand sold to LMVH (for over $300M), and various other smart
and successful investments (including in Uber, Sweetgreen, and
Oatly).</p>

<p>So, musicians can become &ldquo;really really rich&rdquo;, but by leveraging their
music talents and success to become successful entrepreneurs and
investors, not just by being good musicians. (The other two
billionaire musicians accumulated their wealth through non-musical
means also - Paul McCartney probably gets a check from Apple Computer
Inc. every year because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Corps#Apple_Corps_v._Apple_Computer">deal they made about using the &ldquo;Apple&rdquo;
name</a>,
which required annual payments after Apple (Computer) got into the
music business.)</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the video on &ldquo;Music and Measure Theory&rdquo;:
<center>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cyW5z-M2yzw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Thanks to the student who pointed out that the most likely explanation
of why the most widely used music tone system has twelve tones is due
to the property you get by going up by fifths (multiplying frequency
by 3/2).</p>

<p>Music theorists call this the &ldquo;Circle of Fifths&rdquo; (and will draw it as
a circle, returning to the tone after 12 hops), and there are some
good explanations why the 12-tone arrangement has mathematical
advantages (e.g., <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2009/10/02/circle-of-fifths-number-theory/"><em>Circle of fifths and number theory</em></a> by John
Cook).</p>

<p>But, there&rsquo;s also a big mathematical problem with it, since (3/2)^12
is not equal to the same tone you started with (it is <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%283%2F2%29%5E12">129 3057/4096
or approximately
129.75</a>. It is
&ldquo;close enough&rdquo; to 2^7 = 128, but is off by more than <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%283%2F2%29%5E12+%2F+2%5E7">1
percent</a>.</p>

<p>It is an open question (at least to me!) if all of these mathematical
flaws in our tonal systems are okay because no human can perceive ~1%
out-of-tuneness they impose, or if our human ears (brains) have been
so corrupted by listening to many thousands of hours of listening to
out-of-tune imperfect music that but the time we would be knowledgable
enough to do something about it, we&rsquo;ve lost the ability to hear these
differences (indeed, we had to lose it early, otherwise it would be
very annoying going through life thinking everything you hear is a bit
off what it should be).</p>
