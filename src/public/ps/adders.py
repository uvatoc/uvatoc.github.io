"""For this assignment you'll be building arithmetic (specifically, addition) using straightline programs. Keep in mind that straightline programs can be easily converted into boolean gates, meaning that you're actually starting to build components of real integrated circuits here. How neat is that?!

These are going to be using a similar recursive definition of functions as what you saw with LOOKUP from lecture. You'll be able to build "larger" versions of functions out of smaller versions of the same functions.

To begin, we will implement a half adder. Sometimes when adding n-bit numbers together, the result will be n+1 bits long. Consider the sum (in binary) 10+11=101. A half adder is an adder which takes as input two n-bit natural numbers and returns the least significant n bits of their sum. For the previous example, a half-adder would return 01.
