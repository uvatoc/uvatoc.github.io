<p>One important correction from the class: I was spectacularly wrong
about Jay-Z not being &ldquo;really really rich&rdquo;. I was just thinking about
his music income, and even spectacularly successful musicians usually
capture such a small fraction of the value that they create that very
few are &ldquo;really really rich&rdquo;. For purposes of this discussion, I&rsquo;ll
define &ldquo;really really rich&rdquo; as having net worth over $1B, and &ldquo;really
rich&rdquo; as having net worth over $100M. Whether &ldquo;really really rich&rdquo;
people have a higher quality of life than &ldquo;really rich&rdquo; people or even
&ldquo;comfortably rich&rdquo; people, is open to much debate, but for purposes of
dropping $.5M on an old book, it makes a difference if you are &ldquo;really
really rich&rdquo; or just &ldquo;really rich&rdquo;.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.therichest.com/top-lists/top-100-richest-musicians"><em>Top 100 Richest
Musicians</em></a>,
even spectacularly successful muscians like Eminem, Tim McGraw, Stevie
Nicks, Eddie Vedder, and Peter Gabriel don&rsquo;t exceed the &ldquo;really rich&rdquo;
threshold. But, Jay-Z is a billionaire! (Number 1 on this list, along
with two other billionaire &ldquo;musicians&rdquo;, Paul McCartney and Andrew
Lloyd Webber). He&rsquo;s a billionaire because he leveraged his musical
success to be a successful entrepreneur â€” building a music streaming
company, Tidal, which was sold to Square (for around $300M), a
champagne brand sold to LMVH (for over $300M), and various other smart
and successful investments (including in Uber, Sweetgreen, and
Oatly).</p>
<p>So, musicians can become &ldquo;really really rich&rdquo;, but by leveraging their
music talents and success to become successful entrepreneurs and
investors, not just by being good musicians. (The other two
billionaire musicians accumulated their wealth through non-musical
means also - Paul McCartney probably gets a check from Apple Computer
Inc. every year because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Corps#Apple_Corps_v._Apple_Computer">deal they made about using the &ldquo;Apple&rdquo;
name</a>,
which required annual payments after Apple (Computer) got into the
music business.)</p>

<p>Thanks to the student who pointed out that the most likely explanation
of why the most widely used music tone system has twelve tones is due
to the property you get by going up by fifths (multiplying frequency
by 3/2).</p>
<p>Music theorists call this the &ldquo;Circle of Fifths&rdquo; (and will draw it as
a circle, returning to the tone after 12 hops), and there are some
good explanations why the 12-tone arrangement has mathematical
advantages (e.g., <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2009/10/02/circle-of-fifths-number-theory/"><em>Circle of fifths and number theory</em></a> by John
Cook).</p>
<p>But, there&rsquo;s also a big mathematical problem with it, since (3/2)^12
is not equal to the same tone you started with (it is <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%283%2F2%29%5E12">129 3057/4096
or approximately
129.75</a>. It is
&ldquo;close enough&rdquo; to 2^7 = 128, but is off by more than <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%283%2F2%29%5E12+%2F+2%5E7">1
percent</a>.</p>
<p>It is an open question (at least to me!) if all of these mathematical
flaws in our tonal systems are okay because no human can perceive ~1%
out-of-tuneness they impose, or if our human ears (brains) have been
so corrupted by listening to many thousands of hours of listening to
out-of-tune imperfect music that but the time we would be knowledgable
enough to do something about it, we&rsquo;ve lost the ability to hear these
differences (indeed, we had to lose it early, otherwise it would be
very annoying going through life thinking everything you hear is a bit
off what it should be).</p>

      <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>Our plan for how to use the full class meeting times has adapted from
our original plan - we&rsquo;ll provide more justification for the change
below, but the plan now is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Monday classes will be for covering examples, providing context, and
answering student questions about the current week&rsquo;s content,
designed to help students understand the materials you will be
assessed on during your cohort meetings. These will be before any of
that week&rsquo;s assessed cohort meetings, so all students will have the
chance to benefit from these before your assessed cohort meetings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wednesday classes will not cover anything directly related to the
current week&rsquo;s content (since this seems unfair to students who have
their assessed cohort meetings on that material on Mondays or
Tuesdays), but instead will include discussion of the previous
week&rsquo;s problems (so we may discuss problems from week 1 on September
8) and excursions into topics we think are interesting and
enlightening, and that have some connection to the course content,
but that we don&rsquo;t expect would provide any help for the specific
cohort problems you are being assessed on that week.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All the full class meetings are still strictly optional, and we will
not be introducing any new material that you will be assessed on
during these meetings. We will also be live streaming and recording
them - sorry we have had troubles getting decent video and audio for
previous classes. We are working with UVA classroom support to find
the best way to prevent this in the future.</p>
<p>We apologize for any initial confusion about this, but we&rsquo;ve
come to the realization that the plan we had on the syllabus doesn&rsquo;t
make much sense. We worked out the cohort structure during our online
semesters, and the response from the past students was so
overwhelmingly positive that we wanted to figure out how to make it
work for this semester as well. There are some non-trivial adaptations
required to do this, and we&rsquo;re still figuring some of that out. The
most substantial change for this semester is going to be how to best
use our lecture time.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to just use lecture time to teach content like we did
pre-pandemic, since we don&rsquo;t want there to be any pressure on students
who might feel sick, have risk profiles that make them uncomfortable
in high density indoor settings, or otherwise be at risk to come to
class. We also think the video materials we&rsquo;ve produced over the past
year are quite good and cover the course content better than we would
in new live lectures (while providing students with a lot more
flexibility how and when to watch them).</p>
<p>Upon reflection, however, our original plan of essentially duplicating
the Monday classes on Wednesdays, and expecting students in
Monday-Wednesday cohorts to show up on Mondays, and others to show up
on Wednesdays, doesn&rsquo;t seem fair to students or make the best use of
class time. You&rsquo;re paying tuition for a class that is supposed to have
two full class meetings a week, so despite what we said Wednesday
about the expected financial return from learning CS theory, its not
fair to design the class around assuming you would only have one class
a week. But, it also seems like it would be frustrating to students in
the Monday-Tuesday cohorts if we cover materials relevant to the
cohort problems on which they were already assessed in Wednesday
classes. We hope the new plan solves this - it allows everyone in the
class to have a full class meeting that is designed to help on
understanding the content you&rsquo;ll be assessed on in that week&rsquo;s cohort
meeting, and hopefully will allow us to cover a lot of interesting and
worthwhile material in the Wednesday classes.</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t make any promises about this model being in effect until,
say, October 1, but will continue to adapt what we do in the full
class meetings as the semester progresses. The one main risk in this,
though, is if we don&rsquo;t hear from students who are not coming to
classes but would if we were doing something else about why they are
not coming and how to make classes more worthwhile, we are likely to
adapt mostly based on what we hear from the students who do come to
the classes.</p>
<p>Thanks for your patience as we develop this new model, and do let
please us know any suggestions or ideas you have.</p>

<p>Bill Gates&rsquo; very legitimate theoretical computer science paper is: William Gates and Christos Papadimitriou. <a href="/docs/gatespapadimitriou.pdf"><em>Bounds for Sorting by Prefix Reversal</em></a>, Discrete Mathematics, 1979. This co-author also wrote my <em>second favorite</em> comic book on theoretical computer science: <a href="http://www.logicomix.com/en/index.html"><em>Logicomix: An Epic Search for Truth</em></a>.

</li>
</ul>
<p>There should also be a recording available, but unfortunately with
barely audible sound. Sorry for the technical problems with zoom and
recording setup, we are working on getting this to work better and
getting help from the classrooms support before the next class to
hopefully have better results for this for future classes.</p>
