      <description>Goals The main goals for Week 7 are to:
 Understand the proof that Regular Expressions are equivalent in power to Deterministic Finite Automata. This is a long proof, split over 4 videos, but is something we hope everyone understands in detail. The methods used in the proof are similar to ones we have seen before in showing equivalence of NAND-Circ and Boolean circuits, but is a fair bit more complex.</description>

      <description>In general, we&amp;rsquo;re pleased with the responses on the peer evaluation surveys, and it is clear that most students have respect for and are valuing the interactions with their cohortmates. But, one thing we&amp;rsquo;ve heard from some of your peer evaluation surveys, and also felt ourselves, is the difficulty forming a connected community in this on-line environment.
Groups that knew each other and were used to working together pre-pandemic usually were able to move to on-line environments fairly well, and the personal connections already established in the easier in-person environment translate to the on-line environment.</description>

      <description>Professor Brunelle&amp;rsquo;s Office hours must be adjusted slightly. These Changes will begin for this week.
I (Nate) will still have office hours on Wednesdays at 12:00pm-2:00pm, but my Thursday office hours from 3:30pm-5pm will instead be held on Fridays 1:00pm-2:30pm.
The will be held in my zoom room.</description>

      <description>Since a few students asked about using Piazza, I wanted to post an explanation of why I&amp;rsquo;m not willing to use Piazza for any official course interactions here (these are my personal views, which don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the course staff).
The reason I&amp;rsquo;m not willing to use Piazza is their business model is based on surveillance of students and monetizing the data collected through this is ways that may be harmful to students forced to use it.</description>

      <description>Now that we&amp;rsquo;ve had an opportunity to get to know our cohorts, we&amp;rsquo;d like to provide a way for you to offer feedback on how your cohort could work more effectively.
We have created a peer evaluation form for you to reflect on the ways that you and your cohort-mates contribute to your team dynamic. We ask that you please complete this feedback form by 11:59pm on Wednesdsay Sept 23.</description>

      <description>Goals The main goals for Week 4 are to:
 Implement and use the EVAL function. This is our first exposure to a modul of computing which is able to simulate an instance of itself. This idea is fundamental to the practice of computer science, as it enables us to have arbitrarily reprogrammable machines which run with fixed hardware. Begin classifying functions by complexity (i.e. resources required to implement them).</description>

      <description>Week 3: The main goals for Week 3 are to:
 Show how simple models of computing can result in complex behavior. Begin building a bridge from theoretical models of computing (like straightline programs and boolean circuits) to practical implementations of computing (like Python and integrated circuits). Explore the powers and limitations of a model of computing, including being able to understand the details of how to use that model, and why it is defined in the way chosen.</description>

If you don’t, please follow these directions to download Python and PyCharm (you’re welcome to use any IDE that you want, we semi-arbitrarily picked PyCharm).
Windows  Install Python 3.6.4 (If you have a different version of Python, you still must install 3.6.4 seperately!):

      <description>Week 2: Bit Strings and Computing Models At this point you should have been assigned to a cohort and met with them at least twice (once during your assigned prep time and once during your assessed time with a TA). This week, our main goals are:
 Now that you&amp;rsquo;ve had some cohort experience, reflect on how to make the most out of your cohort experience this semester. Begin exploration of the theory of computing, most importantly seeing the motivations for significant themes.</description>

      <description>Honor Expectations As a student at the University of Virginia, you are trusted to be honorable and expected to behave in ways that merit that trust. We take advantage of this trust to provide a better learning environment for everyone. In particular, students in cs3102 are expected to follow these rules throughout the course:
I will not lie, cheat or steal. If I am unsure whether something would be considered lying, cheating or stealing, I will ask before doing it.</description>

      <description>Overview Course Description: The goal of this course is to understand the fundamental limits on what can be efficiently computed in our universe and other possible (or imaginary) universes. These limits reveal deep and mysterious properties about information, communication, and computing, as well as practical issues about how to solve problems.
Two fundamental questions about any problem are:
 Can it be solved using a machine of a certain type?</description>

      <description>Goals The main goals for Week 5 are to:
 Understand what a complexity class is and how to provide properties about circuit-size complexity classes. Learn the asymptotic operators (Big-O, &amp;Omega;, and &amp;Theta;) and how to use them correctly. Be able to both intuitively understand what functions are in O(f(n)), and to prove membership or non-membership. Be able to connect the formal definitions of computing costs to practical questions about the cost of computing.</description>

      <description>Goals The main goals for Week 6 are to:
 Synthesize what we have learned about finite computation in the first 5 weeks, and start exploring unbounded computation.
 Appreciate the connection between functions and languages, and the different ways of talking about computation.
 Understand and be able to formally define a Finite State Automaton, and to reason about the language accepted (or function computed) by a Deterministic Finite Automaton.</description>

      <description>Goals This week, we introduce the most important and widely used model of computation, the Turing machine, and start to address the big question of what can and cannot be computed by any machine with a finite description.
The main goals for Week 8 are to:
 Understand what cannot be computed by a finite automaton and why. Use and understand Turing Machines as a model of computing. Study a definition of computability.</description>

      <description>Goals Last week, we used a counting argument to show that there must be some uncomputable functions (&amp;ldquo;some&amp;rdquo; here means infinitely many), but we didin&amp;rsquo;t find a specific uncomputable function. This week, we prove that a particular function is uncomputable, and explore the implications of finding an uncomputable function.
The main goals for Week 9 are to:
 Understand what cannot be computed by a finite automaton and why. Use and understand Turing Machines as a model of computing.</description>

      <description>A version of this course will be offered in Fall 2020. It is optimistically scheduled for Mondays and Wednesdays, 3:30-4:45 in McLeod Hall 1020 (assuming we will be back to cramming 300 students in a classroom in the fall).
In the happy event that we can offer courses normally in the fall, the content and structure will be fairly similar to what was done in recent semesters. You can see all the materials from recent versions of this course here:</description>

      <description>Welcome to cs3102! The main goals for the first week are:
 Set up the cohorts, and have each group get to know each other and figure out how you will work well together to ensure everyone in your cohort succeeds in the course and has a good experience learning with others.
 Re-awaking the mathematical thinking skills you have (hopefully) developed previously, and start applying them to problems in theory of computing.</description>
