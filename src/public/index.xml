      <description>Week 2: Bit Strings and Computing Models The main goals for Week 2 are:
At this point you should have been assigned to a cohort and met with them at least twice (once during your assigned prep time and once during your assessed time with a TA). This week, our main goals are:
 Now that you&amp;rsquo;ve had some cohort experience, reflect on how to make the most out of your cohort experience this semester.</description>

Assessed cohort meetings will start (at the ealiest) on Tuesday, 1 September, so students scheduled in Tuesday cohorts will have preparation Cohort Meetings on Sunday (30 August), and will need to be ready with the Week 1 problems by their cohort meeting on 1 September. (Other students will have more time, depending on when your assessed cohort meeting is scheduled.</description>

      <description>Honor Expectations As a student at the University of Virginia, you are trusted to be honorable and expected to behave in ways that merit that trust. We take advantage of this trust to provide a better learning environment for everyone. In particular, students in cs3102 are expected to follow these rules throughout the course:
I will not lie, cheat or steal. If I am unsure whether something would be considered lying, cheating or stealing, I will ask before doing it.</description>

      <description>Overview Course Description: The goal of this course is to understand the fundamental limits on what can be efficiently computed in our universe and other possible (or imaginary) universes. These limits reveal deep and mysterious properties about information, communication, and computing, as well as practical issues about how to solve problems.
Two fundamental questions about any problem are:
 Can it be solved using a machine of a certain type?</description>

      <description>A version of this course will be offered in Fall 2020. It is optimistically scheduled for Mondays and Wednesdays, 3:30-4:45 in McLeod Hall 1020 (assuming we will be back to cramming 300 students in a classroom in the fall).
In the happy event that we can offer courses normally in the fall, the content and structure will be fairly similar to what was done in recent semesters. You can see all the materials from recent versions of this course here:</description>

      <description>Welcome to cs3102! The main goals for the first week are:
 Set up the cohorts, and have each group get to know each other and figure out how you will work well together to ensure everyone in your cohort succeeds in the course and has a good experience learning with others.
 Re-awaking the mathematical thinking skills you have (hopefully) developed previously, and start applying them to problems in theory of computing.</description>
