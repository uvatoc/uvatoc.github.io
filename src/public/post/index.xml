      <description>First Class Meeting Our first scheduled class is Wednesday, 25 August, 3:30-4:45pm in Maury Hall 209 (weather permitting, we will also use the Ampitheater space outside Maury).
For this optional first class meeting, we will have an open &amp;ldquo;meet and greet&amp;rdquo; with an opportunity to ask any questions you would like of the course instructors, and an opportunity for students who wish to form their own cohorts (details below) to do so.</description>

      <description>[Updated 18 August 2021]
The cs3102 course will be offered in Fall 2021, co-taught by Nathan Brunelle and David Evans.
Class meetings will be Mondays and Wednesday, 3:30pm - 4:45pm in Maury Hall 209. We will be sending out an email next week with details on the in-person class meetings, but they are being planned in a way that prioritizes safety and comfort while offering an in-person class experience.
We&amp;rsquo;ll be putting more information here about the course as the start of the semester approaches.</description>
