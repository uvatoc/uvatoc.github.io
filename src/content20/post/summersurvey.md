Subject: cs3102: Welcome and Survey Request<br>
<br>

Dear Theory of Computation Students,

Thank you for registering for cs3102!

We’re looking forward to the fall semester, as much as one can under
these circumstances, and considering plans for the course. We are
trying to figure out a model for the course that will provide a fair
and engaging learning environment for everyone, and make the best use
of your time as well as the resources we have for teaching.

The model we are considering is to partition the class into cohorts,
small groups of students, that would have weekly meetings with one of
the course staff (either us, or one of the TAs, with Nathan and I
rotating around the groups), in addition to at least one weekly
meeting without any course staff. We would use these cohort meetings
primarily for learning, with students expected to present and discuss
solutions to assigned problems, and the guides from the course staff
posing questions and helping when students are stuck or confused.

Instead of traditional live lectures, materials would be provided that
cover the concepts and techniques we hope you will learn, including
the textbook, recorded video lectures, and other materials. The
content we cover will be similar to what we’ve done in recent
semesters (see https://uvatoc.github.io/ and
https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~njb2b/cs3102/), and we will again use
Boaz Barak’s excellent Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science
book (freely available from https://introtcs.org/public/index.html).

Most of the learning in a course like this comes from working through
problems, so there would be sets of problems assigned each week, and
an expectation that every student in a cohort is prepared to discuss
solutions to these problems (or at least your attempts to solve them)
during the cohort meetings. These are meant to be low-stress and
focused on learning, not evaluation, but over the course of the
semester we expect there will be enough to fairly assess if students
have learned and are able to use the main ideas in the class. This
means the cohort meetings would be a required and essential part of
the course.

Each week at the assessed cohort meeting, every student will be called
on by a member of the course staff to talk about a problem from that
week's problem set. You will earn full credit for that week if you
demonstrate sufficient understanding of key concepts (enough to make a
reasonable attempt at solving the problem).

We want to avoid overburdening the honor code or disadvantaging
students who may have a hard time finding a distraction-free
environment for a fixed block of time, so plan to avoid having any
traditional exams in the course. Instead, most of the assessment for
the course will come from the cohort meetings. If you generally do
well in these meetings, you can expect an A in the course. You will
receive weekly updates regarding your standing.

To help us get started in planning the semester, we ask that everyone
intending to take the class fill out this survey: https://forms.gle/XVSt47Kqjntot1wK8

We also welcome any general comments or ideas you have, either by
email reply to this message, or if you prefer, you can submit them
[anonymously using collab](https://collab.its.virginia.edu/portal/site/82afbc8d-72a8-4d20-99d9-81791b75303a/tool/49f4300f-5ebb-49bf-918d-868d16877168/main),
we won’t be able to respond directly to anonymously-submitted
comments, though).

Thank you for submitting the survey, and we look forward to hearing
from you and seeing you in cs3102 this fall,

Nathan Brunelle (http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~njb2b/)<br>
