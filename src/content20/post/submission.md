To submit your write-ups and see your feedback, use this site: [Assignment Submissions](https://kytos.cs.virginia.edu/cstheory). This video explains how to use it: [zoomcast](https://virginia.zoom.us/rec/share/B9VQLjWwvHlIwd0OUF8lV_DYXOXth2tcDsH_YWic1dOSKjpxkt3hV27IEWVfxszi.tJMRo97StCFFkVRp)

In general, you will only need to submit your weekly written problem,
and only one member of your cohort needs to submit. Make sure you tell
your cohort coach (TA) who is submitting.
