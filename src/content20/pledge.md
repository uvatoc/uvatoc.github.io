## Honor Expectations

As a student at the University of Virginia, you are trusted to be
honorable and expected to behave in ways that merit that trust. We
take advantage of this trust to provide a better learning environment
for everyone. In particular, students in cs3102 are expected to follow
these rules throughout the course:

**I will not lie, cheat or steal.** If I am unsure whether something
  would be considered lying, cheating or stealing, I will ask before
  doing it.

**I will carefully read and follow the collaboration policy on each
  assignment.** I will not abuse resources in ways that would be
  clearly detrimental to my own learning or unfair to other
  students. Viewing solutions from previous cs3102 courses is not
  permitted, except when explicitly allowed.


## Community Expectations

As a member of a learning community of students, faculty, and staff,
you are expected to exemplify these behaviors in cs3102:

**I will actively affirm the value and dignity of others and treat my
  peers with decency and respect.** I understand that one of the
  benefits of attending the University is to be part of a vibrant
  community that encompasses a wide range of backgrounds, ethnicities,
  personal and family histories, and world views. I will contribute to
  that community by sharing things that are unique about me with
  others, fighting against any biases I may have or that I observe in
  others, and being open to and respectful of people who are different
  from me. I will listen to the perspectives of others, and amplify
  those whose voices are not well heard.

**I will not behave in ways that harrass, intimidate, diminish, or
  belittle others.** If I observe such behaviors in others (including
  among my classmates, the course staff, or other University faculty),
  I will not tolerate them silently, but will either take it upon
  myself to mitigate them, or will inform one of the course
  instructors or another University administrator.

**I will care for myself physically and emotionally.** Staying
  stationary and working at home can make it difficult to maintain
  your physical and emotional well-being. I will ensure that whatever
  I am doing to succeed in my courses does not take priority over my
  needs to exercise, stay hydrated, make time to eat lunch and dinner
  away from your workspace, and to safely spend time outside.

**I will be connected with others, and look out of the well-being of
my classmates.** Even though people are dispersed and distant, The
University of Virginia is still a community, and we hope this class,
and your learning cohort within it, will become one. Be creative in
maintaining and reinforcing that community through the struggles
caused by remoted learning and social distancing, and seek out and
maximize opportunities for virtual social interactions with fellow
students and others in the university community.

**I will ask for help.** I will make a reasonable effort to do things
on my own first, and will work collaboratively with my cohort and
other classmates when permitted, but will ask the course staff for
help before getting overly frustrated. There are many ways to ask for
help including the class discord server and office hours.

**I will be open minded and curious.** I understand that this course
  may do things in ways differently from what I expect, and may
  sometimes buck conventions that have been followed in other courses
  I have taken. I will ask questions when things make me
  uncomfortable, but also accept that being surprised, facing
  uncertainty, and being challenged with problems it is unreasonable
  to expect me to be able to solve, are often beneficial for learning
  new ways of thinking.

**I grant the course staff permission to reproduce excerpts from my
  submissions for teaching purposes.** My work will be attributed when
  it is shown in a postive way, but may be used anonymously if it is
  used to illustrate common pitfalls or other issues.

**I will provide useful feedback.** I realize that this will be
  attempting many new things, and that the cohort model being used
  this semester has not been tried previously. It is important that I
  let the course staff know what they need to improve the course. I
  will provide feedback either anonymously or by contacting the course
  staff directly. I will fill out all requested surveys honestly and
  thoroughly.
