The main point of this is to show that the \"0\" and \"S\" used in the definition are just symbols: we only use string concatenation, extraction, and comparison to build our Natural Number represetation. Of course, this is a ridiculously silly way to represent Natural Numbers if we were actually doing computations on them (especially as Python already provides a built-in integer datatype, which could be naturally used to approximate the Natural Numbers)."
