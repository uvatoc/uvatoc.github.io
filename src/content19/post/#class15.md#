[TCS Chapter 8: Universaility and Uncomputability](/docs/tcs-chapter8.pdf)

Alan M. Turing, [_On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the
Entscheidungsproblem_](/docs/computablenumbers.pdf). 1936. ([bug
fix](/docs/bugfix.pdf)) (You missed your chance to by an [original
printing for GBP 30,000](http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/lot.929.html/2018/the-library-of-erwin-tomash-l18409).)

According to [Scott Aaronson](http://www.scottaaronson.com/),
[_Dori-Mic and the Universal Machine! A Tragicomic Tale of
Combinatorics and Computability for Curious Children of All
Ages_](https://dori-mic.org) is ["The BEST babies' book about
computational universality I've
read."](https://www.amazon.com/review/R1TSEFIBYW9Y6I/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1495944980&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books). I
have free copies available for anyone who needs a holiday present for
a young sibling/cousin/nibling/other person who is behind in her
theoretical computer science education and needs a holiday present for
any cs3102 students who ask.
