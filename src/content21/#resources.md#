## Background

[_Mathematics for Computer Science_ (free
PDF)](https://uvacs2102.github.io/docs/mcs.pdf) by Eric Lehman, F
Thomson Leighton, Albert R Meyer. (This is the book that is sometimes
used in [cs2102: Discrete Math](https://uvacs2102.github.io).) Some
other useful resources for material that is covered in cs2102 are
[here](https://uvacs2102.github.io/resources/).

[forall _x_ (Solutions Booklet from University of Calgary)](http://forallx.openlogicproject.org/solutions/forallxsol.pdf) (P. D. Magnus and Tim Button)

Here are some other materials from cs2012/DMT1 courses that may be useful:
- [Sets Primer](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/luther/DMT1/S2020/sets.html) (from Luther Tychonievich)
- [Proof Techniques](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/luther/DMT1/S2020/techniques-q8.html)
- [Proof Style Guides](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/luther/DMT1/S2020/proofs.html)
- [Glossary of Terms](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/luther/DMT1/S2020/glossary.html)

Harry Porter's [Theory of Computation: Background
Knowledge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOsMcgIK95k) (video) (you
may find his other videos useful for some of the topics we cover also - [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOsMcgIK95k&list=PLbtzT1TYeoMjNOGEiaRmm_vMIwUAidnQz))
