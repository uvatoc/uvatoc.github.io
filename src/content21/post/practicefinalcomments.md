To help you prepare for the final exam, we have posted some comments on the practice exam: [Practice Final Comments](/ps/practice_final_comments.pdf).

Before looking at our comments and hints, though, you should try the [Practice Final](/practice_final) yourself.

As a reminder, for the final you will be allowed **one page** (front
and back) of reference notes to use. You may work with others to
prepare your notes.
