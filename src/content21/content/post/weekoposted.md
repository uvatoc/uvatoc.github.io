The guide and materials for [Week Omega](/weeko) is now posted - see
the [Week Omega](/weeko) page for the details. Note that the schedule
for Monday and Tuesday cohorts changes so you don't need to have
preparation meetings over the Thanksgiving holiday. Week &Omega; is
different &mdash; there will be an assessed cohort meeting in which
you present and answer questions about your project, and have an
opportunity to discuss any concepts you want help with in preparing
for the final exam. 

Our last class will be **Monday, 6 December**, which will help prepare
you for the final exam. The final exam is **Friday, 10 December**, in
the usual classroom, **2-5pm**.

Happy Thanksgiving!
