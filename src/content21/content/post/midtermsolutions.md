We have posted solutions and discussion for the Self-Assessment
Midterm here: [midterm_solutions.pdf](/ps/cs3102_midterm_solutions_2021.pdf)

The slides for the class discussion on the midterm are here: [PDF](https://www.dropbox.com/s/73cdmqtilcqddo7/cs3102f21-oct13-inked.pdf?dl=0). The class is also recorded, which you can find in collab: [Course Recordings](https://collab.its.virginia.edu/portal/site/d8204e9b-8976-4c48-91cb-bab1849d48e7/page/6cc758a9-4ef7-4181-9966-e9ce706e52fb)

We encourage all students to read through the solutions and revisit
your own answers to identify gaps in your understanding. We will
definitely have **several questions on the Final Exam** intended to
test your understanding of the same topics as on the midterm, and
those questions will be similar to the ones here. So, if you do not
understand these problems well enough to solve similar ones on your
own, please come to office hours to discuss them or raise questions in
your cohort meetings.
