<div class="longquote">

_Mr. Henry Poincare, from the Academy of Sciences, member of the Bureau des Longitudes, professor at the Sorbonne, chief mining engineer, author of nearly three hundred original papers which have renowned by their contribution of discoveries and insights, the mathematical physics and celestial mechanics, emits on the political activity of scientists this opinion of good sense._

It is clear that scholars, like all citizens, must take an interest in the affairs of their country. As soon as they have reason to think that their intervention can usefully serve the interests of the nation, they must sacrifice everything to this duty.

Do they have any special obligations in this regard which are not incumbent on other citizens? Do they owe the public more than others? Yes, if they can be more useful to society; and they can be more useful to society if their voice is more likely to be heard. But are their reasons for it to be? The language of passion is the only one that the crowd understands and this language is not theirs.

You ask me whether it is appropriate for them to enter Parliament and take part in power, and whether political activity is likely to thwart or promote their vocation. The answer is easy, politics is today a profession which absorbs the whole person; a scientist who wants to devote themself to it will have to sacrifice their vocation; if they want to be really useful to the country, they must give half to the affairs of their electors; they will no longer have anything left for Science. There is indeed M. Berthelot, but M. Berthelot is irremovable. The irremovable ones are deleteted and there is no likelihood that they will ever be reinstated. Perhaps the representation of minorities with the Spanish system of voting would solve the problem and reopen the Parliament to men who want to be more than politicians.

It would therefore be unfortunate for all scholars to aspire to Parliament, because then there would be no scientists. Whether we sacrifice from time to time someone among us, more apt to make themself understood by crowds or assemblies, we can resign ourselves to it, or even rejoice, not only for the country, but for the science itself, because after all, it has to have someone to defend its interests.

But most of them should be confined to newspaper and magazine articles. I doubt their voices will be heard, amid the din of daily struggles.

Finally, you ask me if the learned politicians should fight or support the policy of the ministerial bloc? Ah! for once, I recuse myself; each of them will have to vote according to their conscience; I guess not everyone will think about this the same way, and I couldn't really complain. If there are scientists in politics, there must be some in all parties, and indeed, it is essential that there always be some on the side in power. Science needs money, and the people in power, those who have the money, must not be able to say to themselves, science is the enemy.
