If you already have python3 on your machine, you should be good to go
for the programming problems.

If you don’t, please follow these directions to download Python and
PyCharm (you’re welcome to use any IDE that you want, we
semi-arbitrarily picked PyCharm).

### Windows

1.  Install Python 3.6.4 (If you have a different version of Python, you still must install 3.6.4 seperately!):
    
    1.  Download [the executable x86-64 installer from python.org](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.4/python-3.6.4-amd64.exe).
    
    2.  Run the installer.
    
    3.  Choose the "Custom Installation" option.
    
    4.  If asked, check "Add Python to environment variables" and "Install for all users"; leave all other options at their default values.

2.  Install PyCharm Community Edition 2020.2.1:
    
    1.  Download [the executable installer from jetbrains.com](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/download-thanks.html?platform=windows&code=PCC).
