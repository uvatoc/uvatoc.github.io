You can find instructor and TA office hours in the calendar below. Some office hours are held remotely, others in person, some both simultaneously. Make sure you check the location in the calendar.

Regardless of where the office hours are held, `#help-requests` channel in discord will be used as our office hours queue. To add yourself to the queue, simply post what you're asking about (e.g. "week1 pancakes video" or "week 1 problem 5" or "countability") and where you're joining from (online versus in-person if there are multiple options at the same time).

If you're attending in person, the TA will come find you when it's your turn on the queue. If you're attending virtually, add yourself to the `Waiting Room` voice channel. The TA will add you to one of the other chat rooms when it is your turn on the queue.
