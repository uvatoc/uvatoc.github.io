# Goals

Last week, we used a counting argument to show that there must be some
uncomputable functions ("some" here means infinitely many), but we
didin't find a specific uncomputable function. This week, we prove
that a particular function is uncomputable, and explore the
implications of finding an uncomputable function.

The main goals for Week 9 are to:

- Identify specific functions that cannot be computed by Turing Machines
- Develop skills for identifying uncomputable problems
- Build strategies for showing new problems to be uncomputable
- Undertand the definition of Universality in the context of Turing Machines

# Cohort Problems

These are the problems you should discuss in your Cohort Meeting, and
everyone in your cohort should be prepared to present and discuss
solutions to at the Assessed Cohort Meeting:

- [Cohort Problems for Week 10 [PDF]](/ps/week10_blank.pdf)
- [LaTeX Template for Week 10 [ZIP]](/ps/week10.zip)

The problems are posted here and we think its a good idea to look at
them early, but you're not expected to be able to solve them until
after doing the readings and watching the videos below.

There is no programming portion for this week.


# Reading

[Chapter 9: _Universality and uncomputability_](https://introtcs.org/public/lec_08_uncomputability.html) [[PDF](https://files.boazbarak.org/introtcs/lec_08_uncomputability.pdf)]

You should read through the end of Section 9.3 (including the "optional" section 9.3.2). (We will cover Section 9.4 and 9.5 next week.)

The material in Sections 9.1 &ndash; 9.3 covers the same concepts as
we do in the lectures, but in a somewhat different order and with a
focus on <em>HALT</em> rather than <em>ACCEPTS</em>. You should
consider how similar and different these two functions are, and
compare the proof that <em>ACCEPTS</em> is uncomputable from the
lectures to the one in the book that <em>HALT</em> is uncomputable.

# Videos

You can play all the videos using this playlist, but don't forget to take breaks: [Week 10 Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ9Gk_8DtbmErIKSl3pEl6KhZfKZWhezW) (note that in previous semesters the week in which this material was covered was labelled week 9).


This week's content is most similar to that of these previous-semester's cs3102 classes:

- (Fall 2019) [Class 14: Computability](https://uvatoc.github.io/f19/class14/): [Full Video](https://uva.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=e086e67f-71aa-45e1-a59d-aaed01412ded), [Slides](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nw9zh8a0vahvaqy/class14-inked.pdf?dl=0) (just part of the _Self-Rejection (An Uncomputable Function)_ video)

- (Fall 2019) [Class 15: Universality and Uncomputability](https://uvatoc.github.io/f19/class15/): [Full Video](https://uva.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=c8ce23af-8a26-44b4-9678-aaef01410d8e), [Slides](https://www.dropbox.com/s/iibngc72d0snb0f/class15-inked.pdf?dl=0)
