# Purpose

Your first peer evaluation is to occur after your week 4 assessed meeting (it is due with your writeup). You will evaluate all cohort-members (including yourself) on 5 items. Each item will have 4 options: exceeds expectations, meets expectations, room for improvement, unsatisfactory. The chart describes example behaviors to merit each category. Select the best fit.

Your responses will be aggregated, anonymized, and then shared with the cohort-mate whom they’re about.  This exercise is nothing more than your first opportunity to express and document feedback, and will not directly impact your cohort-mates’ grades. Our goals are two-fold: 1) To let your cohort-mates know how they’re doing in order to offer encouragement or to provide them opportunity to correct shortcomings, and 2) to help the course staff record how things are going and highlight where they might need to intervene or recognize exceptional performers.

To make sure everyone has an opportunity to grow as a student and as a team player, please do not assess someone more favorably than they deserve. We do not want to be in a situation where someone is under-contributing throughout the semester, is consistently told they’re doing well, but then is suddenly informed that they have not been doing well for months. A little discomfort now will save a lot of discomfort later.

Complementary to that, if you are assessed poorly, try not to be offended or embarrassed. We encourage you to earnestly consider the feedback and then engage in conversation with your cohort-mates. It could be that your cohort-mates’ expectations of you are set too high, it could be that you’re contributing in ways that your cohort-mates have thus far failed to recognize, or it could be that there is legitimately room for improvement on your end. Whatever the case, the best way to proceed is to communicate. Professors Brunelle and Evans are happy to help you to figure out how to start this conversation if you’d like.

# Meta Feedback

To help encourage meaningful comments (whether constructive or complimentary), and to give you an opportunity to contextualize feedback  we will provide everyone an opportunity to provide feedback on the feedback. Look back here in the future for instructions.

# Rubric

| Category | A student who *Exceeds Expectations* might... | A student who *Meets Expectations* might... | A student who has *Room for Improvement* might... | A student whose performance is *Unsatisfactory* might... |
| :------: | :------------------: | :----------------: | :------------------: | :------------: |
| **Attendance** | Participate in extra meetings to help others catch up from absences | Attend all prep and assessed meetings except for in the case of excused absences | Arrive late, leave early, or participate little | Be absent without notice or justification |
| **Learning** | Have strong familiarity with all topics, sufficient to teach others | Know what is covered in readings and videos sufficient to ask about what they don’t understand | Only view and retain content from the videos but not the readings | Be unable to contribute to discussions about course concepts |
| **Problem Set Prep** | Be ready to introduce working ideas or explain non-working attempts for every problem | Understand what every problem is asking and identify relevant concepts | Read but not attempt problems, sometimes skip problems altogether | Rely on cohort-mates to explain problem statements and solutions |
| **Communication** | Check in on wellbeing of cohort-mates, send reminders of deadlines or tasks | Give advance notice of absences, use preferred pronouns, make room for others to contribute or ask questions | Be inactive in responding to messages, respond defensively to questions/comments | Interrupt others, make non-inclusive comments, dominate conversation |
| **Teamwork Initiative** | Provide innovative ideas for how the cohort can run more smoothly, Take over for others who can’t/don’t complete their tasks | Volunteer to attend office hours or take notes during meetings, post questions or statements to discord | Complete tasks when asked, but not volunteer to contribute | Refuse tasks they’re reasonably requested to perform, fail to complete tasks they agree to perform, deny others of opportunities to contribute |
