Wow, the final week - **congratulations!**

This week is different from previous weeks: there is no new technical
content, and no cohort problems.

Instead, the goal of this week is for you to do something that either
synthesizes a key idea from the class, or explores a topic of your
choice related to theoretical computer science.

Although it will be sufficient to earn full credit this week to do
something that just benefits your own understanding, we hope some of
you will produce artifacts that will have value beyond this.


## Collaboration Options

For this assignment, you may work together as a full cohort, or
sub-divide your cohort into groups anyway you choose (e.g., all six
members could work individually on independent projects, you could
split into two teams of three, or any other way of partitioning your
cohort into disjoint sets). The expectations for quality and value of
your submission scale according to the square root of the number of
members in a group (so if all six members of a cohort work together,
you would be expected to do something at least sqrt(6) = 2.45... as
impressive as what an individual would do working alone).

# Schedule

Because of the Thanksgiving holiday and the end of the semester, the
schedule will adjust so the Monday and Tuesday cohorts will have your
assessed cohort meetings one week later (on December 6 and December 7).

We includethe normal preparation Cohort Meetings in this schedule, but
depending on how you partition your cohort you will probably want to
plan things differently. If you decide to all work independently, no
need for a cohort meeting (unless you want to still discuss your plans
or just hang out); if you are working in sub-groups, you will probably
need several meetings of your sub-group; if you are all working
together, you will probably need additional cohort meetings.

The assessed meetings will happen as scheduled (unless you arrange
something else with your TA). For the final assessed cohort meeting,
you will present your project for this assignment and answer questions
about it, and use any additional time to discuss anything else you
want (including questions to prepare for the final exam).

**Monday, 6 December** is the last full class. We will use the class
  time to review for the final exam and synthesize material from the
  course.

**Friday, 10 December**: **Final Exam** (2-5pm in Maury Hall 209).

## Video

There's only one video for Week Omega &mdash; a course wrap-up that recaps the main themes we've seen in cs3102:

(You won't be asked questions about this in the cohort meetings, but
we do hope you'll find it worthwhile.)

## Assignment

**Create an artifact that conveys some idea related to this class.**

Your artifact can be anything you want, so long as it includes some
representation as a finite sequence of bits that can be posted on the
Internet. Examples of possible artifacts include a written story, a
comic, a video, a song (lyrics), or an interpretive dance.

If your artifact cannot be posted on the Internet (for example, if you
bake lasagna, build a quantum computer, or develop a time machine) you
should still make some description of your artifact (including a video
or pictures if helpful) that can be posted.

## Target Audience

You can define your target audience but should specify what it
is. Examples of target audiences include “five year olds”, “typical
third graders”, “your parents”, "professional programmers without
formal CS background", “UVa students majoring in history”, “Martians”,
“cs1110 students”, or "future cs3102 students".

## Evaluation Criteria

At your assessed cohort meeting, you will present your artifact to
your cohort, and your Cohort Leader (and cohortmates) may ask
questions about it.

Your artifact will be evaluated on technical correctness and perceived
effectiveness in conveying an important idea to your defined target
audience. Aesthetic merit, entertainment value, production quality,
and creativity are also important, but only in as much as they support
the goal of conveying an idea related to theoretical computer science
to your target audience.

## Examples

We don't want to limit your creativity, but here are some examples
from previous courses for a similar assignments. (Note that most of
these are on topics that would not be appropriate for cs3102, but they
might still give you ideas for things to do.)
