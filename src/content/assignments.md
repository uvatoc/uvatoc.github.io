# Submitting Assignments, Viewing Grades

To submit your write-ups and see your feedback, use this site: [Assignment Submissions](https://kytos.cs.virginia.edu/cstheory)

To see how to use it, reference [this video](https://virginia.zoom.us/rec/share/B9VQLjWwvHlIwd0OUF8lV_DYXOXth2tcDsH_YWic1dOSKjpxkt3hV27IEWVfxszi.tJMRo97StCFFkVRp)


In general, you will only need to submit your weekly written problem, and only one member of your cohort needs to submit. Make sure you tell your cohort coach (TA) who is submitting.
