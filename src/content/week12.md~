# Goals


This week we arrive at the most famous and foundational open problem
in Computer Science (and, arguably, in all of Mathematics, and more
questionably, perhaps of all human creative endeavor): _is it
substantially easier to verify the solution to a (certain very broad
and common type of) problem, than it is to find that solution?_
(stated more formally in computer science as "P = NP?".

The main goals for Week 12 are to:

- Understand how to talk about the hardness ("difficulty") of computing functions.
- Learn about a few examples of problems that appear to have surprisingly different difficulties.
- Be able to talk about the _tractability_ of problems, and understand what computer scientists categorize problems as tractable and intractable the way we do.
- Understand precisely the definition of the complexity class NP, and two different ways of defining it.
- Be able to prove a problem is in class NP.
- Understand the P=NP question and its significance.
- See how we might be able to make progress on determining if P=NP, and understand the Cook-Levin Theorem and the main idea behind its proof.

# Cohort Problems

These are the problems you should discuss in your Cohort Meeting, and
everyone in your cohort should be prepared to present and discuss
solutions to at the Assessed Cohort Meeting:

- [Cohort Problems for Week 12 [PDF]](/ps/week12_blank.pdf)
- [LaTeX Template for Week 12 [ZIP]](/ps/week12.zip)

The problems are posted here and we think its a good idea to look at
them early, but you're not expected to be able to solve them until
after doing the readings and watching the videos below.

Similarly to Week 5, for this week you will be assigned a _new_
problem to solve for your write-up problem which you will need to
solve on your own without any collaboration. This will be due 48 hours
after your cohort meeting (instead of the usual 24 hours). This
problem will expect you to do a reduction proof, similar to the ones
in the cohort problems (but different enough to be new).

# Reading

This week's content is covered in several chapters in the TCS
book. This is a lot of reading material, but you should consider it
all "optional" this week - you are not expected to read these in
detail, but should find the textbook a useful complement to the
lecture content to have an alternate presenation of the materials and
a refernce for some of the technical details that we do not cover in
depth in the lectures.
