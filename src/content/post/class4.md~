Here's the video on "Music and Measure Theory":

The most likely explanation of why the most widely used music tone
system has twelve tones is due to the property you get by going up by
fifths (multiplying frequency by 3/2). Music theorists call this the
"Circle of Fifths", and there are some good explanations why the
12-tone arrangement has mathematical advantages (e.g., [_Circle of
fifths and number theory_] by John Cook). But, there's also a big
mathematical problem with it, since (3/2)^12 is not equal to the same
tone you started with (it is [129 3057/4096 or approximately
129.75](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%283%2F2%29%5E12). It is
"close enough" to 2^7 = 128, but is off by more than [1
percent](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%283%2F2%29%5E12+%2F+2%5E7). It
is an open question (at least to me!) if all of these mathematical
flaws in our tonal systems are okay because no human can perceive ~1%
out-of-tuneness they impose, or if our human ears (brains) have been
so corrupted by listening to many thousands of hours of listening to
out-of-tune imperfect music that but the time we would be knowledgable
enough to do something about it, we've lost the ability to hear these
differences (indeed, we had to lose it early, otherwise it would be
very annoying going through life thinking everything you hear is a bit
off what it should be).
