Turing's paper is: A. M. Turing, [_On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem_](/docs/computablenumbers.pdf), 12 November 1936.

Charles Petzold's book, [_The Annotated Turing: A Guided Tour Through Alan Turing's Historic Paper on Computability and the Turing Machine_](https://www.amazon.com/Annotated-Turing-Through-Historic-Computability/dp/0470229055) provides a detailed explanation of everything in the paper and is a great read.
