Some solutions and hints on the practice final are here:
[practicefinal-comments.pdf](/docs/practicefinal-comments.pdf). (If
there are questions about problems with incomplete solutions, we might
add to this later.)

We won't have the regular office hours schedule now that the end of
classes has passed, but still have many office hours scheduled until
the final exam on May 11. Please check the course calendar (and
discord announcements) for information on office hours for this week
and next week.
