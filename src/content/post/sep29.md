The full fabricated interview with Henri Poincaré is [_Mathematics is the art of
giving the same name to different things_](http://www.nieuwarchief.nl/serie5/pdf/naw5-2012-13-3-154.pdf) by Ferdinand Verhulst, 3 September 2012.

The quote I used on the last slide is (translated) from _La Revue Bleue_ (_Revue politique et littéraire_) 1904: 

> Well, this time I have to excuse myself; everybody will have to choose according to his conscience. I think that not everybody will cast the same vote, and I see no reason to complain about this. If scientists take part in politics, they should take part in all parties, and it is indeed necessary that they be present in the strongest party. Science needs money, and it should not be such that the people with power can say, science, that is the enemy.

(I have not been able to find an original source for this, only the
translated excerpt from that article. If anyone can track down an
original, that is worth at least a portable whiteboard.)

Donald Knuth's article: [_Big Omicron and big Omega and big Theta_](docs/knuth_big_omicron.pdf), ACM SIGACT NewsVolume 8Issue 2April-June 1976.
