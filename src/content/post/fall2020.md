A version of this course will be offered in Fall 2020. It is
optimistically scheduled for Mondays and Wednesdays, 3:30-4:45 in
McLeod Hall 1020 (assuming we will be back to cramming 300 students in
a classroom in the fall).

In the happy event that we can offer courses normally in the fall, the
content and structure will be fairly similar to what was done in Fall
2019, and you can see all the materials from that course on this
website.
