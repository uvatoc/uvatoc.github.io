Here are the links to the Turing Machine simulations:

As mentioned in class, there are lots of different ways to define a
Turing Machine, and no agreed upon standard definition.  None of the
small changes to the definition impact the set of functions that can
be computed (as we will see in upcoming classes), but they do impact
how hard it might be to write programs and prove properties about
Turing Machines.

Some of the issues about the choices for the
definition used in the book are here, including the question asked
about if we really need the "Stay" direction:
