Theory of Computation (renumbered as cs3120, but very similar to the
course previously numbered as cs3102) will be offered in Spring 2023,
co-taught by
[Mohammad&nbsp;Mahmoody](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~mohammad/) and 
[David&nbsp;Evans](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/evans/).

Class meetings will be Tuesdays and Thursdays, 9:30 &ndash; 10:45am in
Olsson Hall 120.

We'll be putting more information here about the course as the start
of the semester approaches.

For now, you can see what the course was like in previous semesters
from Prof. Brunelle's [Fall 2022
course](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~njb2b/cstheory/f2022/index.html)
and from the archived course websites from [Fall 2021](/f21), [Fall
2020](/f20), and [Fall 2019](/f19). The design of the Spring 2023
course is not set yet, but it will most likely be a combination of
aspects of the previous semesters and some new variations.  Most of
the content in the course will be similar to what was covered last
fall and in pervious offerings of cs3102, with some adjustments due to
the new curriculum (which makes DSA2 a prereq for this course).

We look forward to seeing you at the first class, Thursday, 19
January, at 9:30am in Olsson 120.
