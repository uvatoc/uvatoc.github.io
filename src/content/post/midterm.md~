The Self-Assessment Midterm is posted here: [midterm.pdf](/ps/midterm.pdf)

This self-assessment midterm is intended to help prepare you to do
well on the final by giving you experience taking an exam, but without
any grade pressure or logistical challenges.

This exam will not be graded, but you do need to upload an image of
your exam by **2:59pm Wednesday, 13 October**. You are encouraged to
print out the exam to do on paper, and take it under realistic exam
conditions. The exam is designed for a 75-minute class period, so you
should not spend longer than that to complete it. When you have
finished the exam, take pictures of your exam for the upload. It is
not necessary to typeset your exam (and doing the exam on paper better
simulates what you will do for the final).

This exam covers material from Weeks 1--5 of the course, including the assigned reading and video materials. Most of the questions on the exam will cover topics that have been covered in the assigned cohort problems. You should prepare a one-page (letter-size, two-sided) reference sheet for use during the exam, but all other resources are forbidden (no internet, textbook, other humans, magnification instruments, etc.). We expect that students will benefit from thinking about what to put on your reference sheet in preparing for the exam, and you may work with anyone you want (including your cohort-mates and other students in the class) to prepare a reference sheets together.

For this exam, you must {\bf work alone}.  You are not permitted to obtain help from people other than asking clarifying questions of the course staff.  You are not permitted to provide help to others taking
the exam. {\bf You may not use any resources other than your brain and body, the one page of notes you prepared, and a simple writing implement like a pen or pencil.}
