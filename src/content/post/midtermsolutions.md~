We have posted solutions and discussion for the Self-Assessment
Midterm here: [midterm_solutions.pdf](/ps/cs3102_midterm_solutions_2021.pdf)

This self-assessment midterm is intended to help prepare you to do
well on the final by giving you experience taking an exam, but without
any grade pressure or logistical challenges.

This exam will not be graded, but you do need to upload an image of
your exam by **2:59pm Wednesday, 13 October**. You are encouraged to
print out the exam to do on paper, and take it under realistic exam
conditions. The exam is designed for a 75-minute class period, so you
should not spend longer than that to complete it and should work on
the exam alone, without using any resources other than the one-page
reference sheet you prepare (see below).

When you have finished the exam, take pictures of your exam for the
upload. It is not necessary to typeset your exam (and doing the exam
on paper better simulates what you will do for the final). We will
look at the uploaded exams to get a sense of how the class is doing,
and to confirm that you've put effort into doing the exam, but will
not be grading these on performance.

The exam covers material from Weeks 1--5 of the course, including the
assigned reading and video materials. Most of the questions on the
exam will cover topics that have been covered in the assigned cohort
problems.

**Reference Sheet.** You should prepare a one-page (letter-size,
two-sided) reference sheet for use during the exam, but all other
resources are forbidden (no internet, textbook, other humans,
magnification instruments, etc.). We expect that students will benefit
from thinking about what to put on your reference sheet in preparing
for the exam, and you may work with anyone you want (including your
cohort-mates and other students in the class) to prepare a reference
sheets together. For the Final Exam, you will also be able to use a
reference sheet you prepare.
