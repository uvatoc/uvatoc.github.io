Now that we've had an opportunity to get to know our cohorts, we'd like to provide a way for you to offer feedback on how your cohort could work more effectively.

We have created a [peer evaluation form](https://forms.gle/o3foMt3NLuLuANRF6) for you to reflect on the ways that you and your cohort-mates contribute to your team dynamic. We ask that you please complete this feedback form by 11:59pm on Wednesdsay Sept 23.

After that time, we will release your feedback anonymously to the cohort-mates. Your comments will be seen by the person they're about, but you will not see anyone else's comments about that person, nor will that person know who made the comments. Please be tactful and constructive.
