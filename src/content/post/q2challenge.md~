As discussed in [Class 5](/class5), there was a problem on Quiz 2 that
both the professors got wrong probably more than once.

Although it was meant to be a fairly straightforward multiple choice
question, it illustrates how tricky it is to think about the
subtleties of simple definitions on binary relations and the
importance of precise definitions.

The question, as asked on Quiz 2 is below:

**Question 2: Notions of Relations**

Which of the following are true statements for *all* sets $$X$$ and $$Y$$? Choose all that are correct:

[X] If there is a bijection between sets $$X,Y$$, then there is an injective ($$ \le 1$$ in) function ($$ \le 1$$ out) from $$X$$ to $$Y$$.
[ ] If there is a partial function from $$X$$ to $$Y$$, then there is surjective mapping ($$ \ge 1$$ in) from $$Y$$ to $$X$$.
[ ] There is a total ($$ \ge 1$$ out) function from $$Y$$ to $$X$$ if and only if there is a surjective mapping from $$X$$ to $$Y$$.
[ ] If there is a surjective total function from $$X$$ to $$Y$$, then there is an injective mapping from $$X$$ to $$Y$$.
