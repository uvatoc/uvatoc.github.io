Exam 1 will be in class on Thursday, 2 March.

It will cover material from Classes 1 &ndash; 9, Problem Sets 1
&ndash; 4 (including the provided comments), Quizzes 1 &ndash; 4, and
Chapter 1 &ndash; 5 of the TCS Book. Nearly everything on the exam
will have been covered in at least three of these places (e.g., in
class, on a problem set, and in the textbook; or in multiple classes,
the textbook, and a quiz).

As a reminder from the syllabus, you may prepare a **one-page
(letter-size, two-sided) reference sheet for use during the exam**,
but all other resources are forbidden (no internet, textbook, other
humans, magnification instruments, etc.). We expect that students will
benefit from thinking about what to put on your reference sheet in
preparing for the exam, and you may work with anyone you want
(including other students in the class) to prepare your reference
sheets together.

The problems in the PDF linked above should give you an idea what to
expect on the Exam &mdash; problems 1 &ndash; 9 are essentially an
example of a full Exam 1 (from the Fall 2019 course, but with a few
edits to some questions and whitespace removed), so similar in length
to what you should expect for the exam on March 2. If you want to see
the original exam that was given to students in 2019 (which is closer
in content and structure to this semester's course than the
pandemic-adjusted offerings since then), you are welcome to look at
that also:
[https://uvatoc.github.io/f19/exam1comments/](https://uvatoc.github.io/f19/exam1comments/).

The 2019 exam does not cover some of the topics we have covered for
this Exam, so we have also provided some additional practice problems
after the practice exam.

We will post solutions and comments for some of these problems (and
are happy to answer any questions you have about them), but encourage
you to first try them on your own, then in discussion with other
students if possible, before looking at the solutions (hopefully to
verify your own answer is correct, and to see other approaches). We
emphasize, though, that you are not expected to solve all of these
problems and there is no submission expected for these. The problems
are provided to give you problems to practice and check your
understanding in preparing for the exam. If you are able to solve
these problems, you should be confident that you'll be able to do well
on the exam.
