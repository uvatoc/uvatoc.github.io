One thing we've heard from some of your peer evaluation surveys, and
also felt ourselves, is the difficulty forming a connected community
in this on-line environment. Groups that knew each other and were used
to working together pre-pandemic usually were able to move to on-line
environments fairly well, and the personal connections already
established in the easier in-person environment translate to the
on-line environment. I've seen similar things in comparing groups that
have nearly all of their interactions on-line but have one or two
in-person meetings a year, to ones that never meet in person. Without
the in-person meetings, the level of familiarity and comfort that
comes from feeling like you know who someone is are very hard to
attain.
