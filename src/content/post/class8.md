Quiz 4 is in GradeScope (after noon today) and due Wednesday, 9:59pm. As posted in discord, the collaboration policy for the quizzes has changed (including for this quiz): From now on, you are permitted to use resources for quizzes, but not to discuss the problems with other people. You may use your notes, the course textbook, posted class slides/videos, and any other materials you want while you take the quiz. It is fine to look at the quiz questions, and then to consult these resources before submitting your answers.

Problem Set 4 is due on **Monday, 20 February (9:59pm)**: [https://overleaf.com/read/hsxfrxnsvyfw](https://overleaf.com/read/hsxfrxnsvyfw) (there is no Jupyter notebook part of this problem set).
