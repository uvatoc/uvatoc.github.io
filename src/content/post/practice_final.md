We have written and posted a [practice final](/ps/cs3102_midterm_solutions_2021.pdf). This practice final is intended to give you an idea of the variety of question styles, question difficulty, and length that you can expect on the actual exam. Specific topics present, topic prevalence, and point breakdown may be different for the final exam.

For the real final you will be allowed one page (front and back) of reference notes to use. We recommend that you try your best to mimic the real exam experience for this practice exam. That means we recommend that you study before the exam, make a reference sheet, and then allocate 3 hours of time to complete the exam.

Enjoy and happy studying!

Nate and Dave
