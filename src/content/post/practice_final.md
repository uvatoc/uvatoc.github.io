The final exam is scheduled (by the registrar) for Friday, 10
December, 2-5pm in our lecture classroom.

To help you prepare for the final exam, we have posted a practice exam:
[practice final](/ps/practice_final.pdf).

This practice final is intended to give you an idea of the variety of
question styles, question difficulty, and length that you can expect
on the actual exam.

Based on what you have learned in cs3102 this semester, you should be
able to answer all of the questions in the practice exam well (and if
you can do this, you should expect to get an A on the final). Specific
topics present, topic prevalence, and point breakdown may be different
for the final exam, but it will include similar types of questions and
like the practice exam will focus on evaluating your understanding of
the most important concepts in the course.

For the real final you will be allowed one page (front and back) of
reference notes to use. We recommend that you try your best to mimic
the real exam experience for this practice exam. That means we
recommend that you study before the exam, make a reference sheet, and
then allocate 3 hours of time to complete the exam.

After you have done this, feel free to ask others (including the
course staff) for help on any questions. We will discuss some of the
problems in class (and may post written solutions to them).

Enjoy and happy studying!

Nate and Dave
