As we approach the end of the semester I would first like to congratulate everyone on a job well done so far! It's been quite a strange semester with coming back to in-person classes (or for many of you taking in-person classes at UVA for the first time), and you have all handled the uncertainty exceptionally well. We are very proud of what you've acheived and we hope that you are proud of yourselves as well.

The last few weeks of the semester will look different from our typical pattern. We summarize the remainin schedule below:

- **Week 12**: Week 12 is the last week which will introduce new material and the Week 12 Writeup will be the last writeup you are doing this semester. 
- **Week 13**: There will be no prep or assessed cohort meetings for Week 13. Instead, for Week 13 we will provide practice problems and a practice exam for you to complete on your own time. You do not need to turn those in, but we hope you will complete the problems as if it was a real exam. This means studying in advance, drafting a 1-page (front and back) "cheat-sheet" of notes to use on the exam (you will be allowed one during the real final), and setting aside a 3 hour window to attempt the exam. After this we encourage you to discuss your solutions with class-mates. We will post and announcement when the practice is available.
- **Week 14**: There will not be videos or a problem set associated with Week 14. Instead, we will ask you to complete a mini-project related to the course. The time we're expecting you to spend on this project should be commensurate with the time you would normally spend watching videos, doing readings, and working on problem sets. You will have prep and assessed cohort meetings for this week where you will discuss and present your projects. We'll elaborate more details when the Week 14 guide is posted. *Important note for Cohorts that meet Sunday+Monday and Saturday+Tuesday!* Since your prep meetings would normally meet over the Thanksgiving break, your week 14 will be delayed by 1 week, so your prep meetings will happen on Dec 4-5 and your assessed meetings will happen on Dec 5-6. Let us know if this presents a problem for you.

Lecture time for the remaining 2 weeks will primarily be review time. We'll go over problems from start to finish, remind you of important concepts, etc. Please let us know if there's something in particular you would like for us to cover again and we'll be happy to. We will likely bring up some new topics exclusively for providing more modern context of course topics, but no new material will show up on the final exam. This should be a good time to reflect on the course and what we've learned, so we encourage people to show up. We will provide snacks for all future course meetings (starting 11/22).

Thanks everyone for all of your hard work,
Nathan and Dave
