Problem Set 3 ([Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/kvfjnywhnxrw), [Jupyter](https://uvatoc.github.io/ps/ps3.ipynb)) is due Monday, 13 February, 9:59pm.

As was pointed out to me by an intrepid student after class, what I
said about { OR, NOT } being not universal since we included AND in
our AON Circuits is badly wrong! One easy way to see this is we know
we can convert between { AND, NOT } and { OR, NOT } using De Morgan's
laws, so we can construct AND from { OR, NOT }. Although it seems
disturbing that we are focusing on { AND, OR, NOT }, and it is not a
minimal universal gate set, we already knew this from showing that {
NAND } is univeral (and obviously, we can build NAND with just { AND,
NOT }.
