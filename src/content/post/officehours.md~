We will post a more complete office hours schedule by early next week.

I will have office hours on Wednesdays at 9-10am, starting tomorrow
(Wednesday, August 26). For now, we'll use [my zoom
office](https://virginia.zoom.us/s/2024003839) (but these will move to
the course discord server once everyone is set up there).
