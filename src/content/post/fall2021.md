The cs3102 course will be offered in Fall 2021, co-taught by [Nathan Brunelle](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~njb2b/) and [David Evans](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/evans/).

Class meetings (expected to be in person, pending any University
policy changes) will be Mondays and Wednesday, 3:30pm - 4:45pm in
Maury Hall 209.

We'll be putting more information here about the course as the start
of the semester approaches. For now, you can see what the course was
like last year from this website (including the syllabus from the Fall
2020 course: [Fall 2020
Syllabus](https://uvatoc.github.io/syllabus/)). You can also see the
[Fall 2019](https://uvatoc.github.io/f19/) course, which was the
previous (pre-Covid) version of the course. The design of the Fall
2021 course is not set yet, but it will most likely be a combination
of aspects of the previous (lockdown) semesters, and what we did for
the last in-person version (Fall 2019).
