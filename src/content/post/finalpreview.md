A preview of the final exam is posted: 
[Final Preview](/ps/final_preview.pdf).

We don't want anyone to be surprised by what is on the exam, or not
read the instructions carefully because you are in a stressful exam
setting, so we encourage you to read the exam preview now. (This
doesn't include the full questions, of course, since we still want to
see you demonstrate the ability to solve problems on your own during
the exam.)
