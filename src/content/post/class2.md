The slides for Class 2 (1 September) are here:

Some relevant links for the class:

- [Companies by Market
  Capitalization](https://companiesmarketcap.com/) (Facebook is now
  down to $1.060, from $1.069 on Wednesday morning, so there is still
  hope they will fall off the list.)

- Here's the one paper from a Google co-founder that I could find which actuall contains a legitimate theorem and proof: Sergey Brin, Rajeev Motwani, Craig Silverstein. [_Beyond Market Baskets: Generalizing Association Rules to Correlations_](/docs/beyondmarketbaskets.pdf). In SIGMOD 1997. The more famous paper that includes the _PageRank_ definition is: Lawrence Page, Sergey Brin, Rajeev Motwani, Terry Winograd. [_The PageRank Citation Ranking:
Bringing Order to the Web_](http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/422/1/1999-66.pdf). Stanford Report, 1999.

- Bill Gates' very legitimate theoretical computer science paper is: William Gates and Christos Papadimitriou. [_Bounds for Sorting by Prefix Reversal_](/docs/gatespapadimitriou.pdf), Discrete Mathematics, 1979. This co-author also wrote my _second favorite_ comic book on theoretical computer science: [_Logicomix: An Epic Search for Truth_](http://www.logicomix.com/en/index.html). (We won't get to my favorite comic book until you have a deeper understanding of universal computation, but it does have an [indirect connection](https://dori-mic.org/) to Bill Gates' paper.

There should also be a recording available, but unfortunately with
barely audible sound. Sorry for the technical problems with zoom and
recording setup, we are working on getting this to work better and
getting help from the classrooms support before the next class to
hopefully have better results for this for future classes.
