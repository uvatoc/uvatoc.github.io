The slides for Class 2 (1 September) are here:
[class2.pdf](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tlro4vwhi25jefh/class2.pdf?dl=0)

There should also be a recording available, but unfortunately with
barely audible sound. Sorry for the technical problems with zoom and
recording setup, we are working on getting this to work better and
getting help from the classrooms support before the next class to
hopefully have better results for this for future classes.
