We will post a more complete office hours schedule by early next week.

I (Dave) will have office hours on Wednesdays at 9-10am (including
tomorrow, Wednesday, August 26) and Fridays at 10-11am (including this
Friday, August 28).  For now, these will use [my zoom
office](https://virginia.zoom.us/s/2024003839) (but these will move to
the course discord server once everyone is set up there).
