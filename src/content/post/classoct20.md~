One important correction from the class: I was spectacularly wrong
about Jay-Z not being "really really rich". I was just thinking about
his music income, and even spectacularly successful musicians usually
capture such a small fraction of the value that they create that very
few are "really really rich". For purposes of this discussion, I'll
define "really really rich" as having net worth over $1B, and "really
rich" as having net worth over $100M. Whether "really really rich"
people have a higher quality of life than "really rich" people or even
"comfortably rich" people, is open to much debate, but for purposes of
dropping $.5M on an old book, it makes a difference if you are "really
really rich" or just "really rich".

According to [_Top 100 Richest
Musicians_](https://www.therichest.com/top-lists/top-100-richest-musicians),
even spectacularly successful muscians like Eminem, Tim McGraw, Stevie
Nicks, Eddie Vedder, and Peter Gabriel don't exceed the "really rich"
threshold. But, Jay-Z is a billionaire! (Number 1 on this list, along
with two other billionaire "musicians", Paul McCartney and Andrew
Lloyd Webber). He's a billionaire because he leveraged his musical
success to be a successful entrepreneur &mdash; building a music streaming
company, Tidal, which was sold to Square (for around $300M), a
champagne brand sold to LMVH (for over $300M), and various other smart
and successful investments (including in Uber, Sweetgreen, and
Oatly).

So, musicians can become "really really rich", but by leveraging their
music talents and success to become successful entrepreneurs and
investors, not just by being good musicians. (The other two
billionaire musicians accumulated their wealth through non-musical
means also - Paul McCartney probably gets a check from Apple Computer
Inc. every year because of the [deal they made about using the "Apple"
name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Corps#Apple_Corps_v._Apple_Computer),
which required annual payments after Apple (Computer) got into the
music business.)
