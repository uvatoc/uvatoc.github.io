Here are my (Dave) answers to questions from the course registration
survey. If you have new questions that weren't answered, or want to
follow-up on anything, please feel free to do so either in office
hours, on Discord, or by email.

> Do you two have a passion for computer science or a specific topic within computer science, why is that? What do you think about you or your past primed you to develop this interest?


> how far are we until quantum computing is in our hands


> More about instructor backgrounds

> Where will we be able to find a schedule of readings to stay consistent with the lecture materials? I like to do the corresponding reading before class. 


> As mentioned in the article Habits of Highly mathematical people, I think it is still a valid question to ask how the knowledge we take away from this class can be effectively be used in my career in Software Engineering.

> What are your histories? Why do you personally want to teach this class? I would like to learn how computing can be better utilized in today's world and part of answering how it can be "better utilized" is to know where it cannot be utilized. So I want to know if there are any strong clues when asked a business problem that will tell a future tech worker like me that this problem cannot be solved with computers. 


> Do we discuss AI?

> Will we see the results of computational theory currently being researched?

> How closely tied are the contents of the textbook to the contents of the course? How comprehensive is the information in the textbook?  

> How many proofs will we write

The number of proofs you write will be countable, and I can even
promise it will be finite!

> When will quantum computing be in our hands?


> Do the instructors have any pets? Would love to see some pictures of them :)


> I would like to know what are the most challenging topics we are going to cover and how to best succeed in this class. 

> I want to continue strengthening my knowledge of the "language" of discrete math. In CS3100 this past fall, I found that it took me longer than I would have liked to decipher the meaning of the symbolic terminology which was quite common on a lot of the slides and in the textbook, which harmed by comprehension ability, forcing me to review more on my own.  I hope that with additional exposure, this process eventually becomes second nature to me, and I'll be able to just focus on the content itself.

> I would like to know how to approach very complicated problems and how to better understand them. I feel like often times when I see a complicated problem, I feel sort of "out in open water" and without the tools to help me.
