Problem Set 3 is now posted and due on **Monday, 13 February (9:59pm)**.

This problem set focuses on understanding finite computation in the Boolean circuit and programming models (Chapter 3 of TCS), and understanding how we prove Boolean circuits can compute every finite function (Chapter 4 of TCS).

The latex template for Problem Set 3 is here: [https://www.overleaf.com/read/kvfjnywhnxrw](https://www.overleaf.com/read/kvfjnywhnxrw)

The problems PDF is: [ps3.pdf](/ps/ps3.pdf).

The Jupyter notebook for PS3 is [ps3.ipynb](/ps/ps3.ipynb).
