One important correction from the class: I was spectacularly wrong
about Jay-Z not being "really really rich". I was just thinking about
his music income, and even spectacularly successful musicians usually
capture such a small fraction of the value that they create that very
few are "really really rich" (for purposes of this discussion, I'll
define "really really rich" as having net worth over $1B, and "really
rich" as having net worth over $100M).

According to [_Top 100 Richest
Musicians_](https://www.therichest.com/top-lists/top-100-richest-musicians),
even spectacularly successful muscians like Eminem, Tim McGraw, Stevie
Nicks, Eddie Vedder, and Peter Gabriel don't exceed the "really rich"
threshold. But, Jay-Z is a billionaire! (Number 1 on this list, along
with two other billionaire "musicians", Paul McCartney and Andrew
Lloyd Webbed). He's a billionaire because he leveraged his musical
success to be a successful entrepreneur - building a music streaming
company, Tidal, which was sold to Square (for around $300M), a
champagne brand sold to LMVH (for over $300M), and various other smart
and successful investments (including in Uber, Sweetgreen, and
Oatly). So, musicians can become "really really rich", but by
leveraging their music talents and success to become tech
entrepreneurs.



Here's the video on "Music and Measure Theory":

Thanks to the student who pointed out that the most likely explanation
of why the most widely used music tone system has twelve tones is due
to the property you get by going up by fifths (multiplying frequency
by 3/2).

Music theorists call this the "Circle of Fifths" (and will draw it as
a circle, returning to the tone after 12 hops), and there are some
good explanations why the 12-tone arrangement has mathematical
advantages (e.g., [_Circle of fifths and number theory_](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2009/10/02/circle-of-fifths-number-theory/) by John
Cook).

But, there's also a big mathematical problem with it, since (3/2)^12
is not equal to the same tone you started with (it is [129 3057/4096
or approximately
129.75](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%283%2F2%29%5E12). It is
"close enough" to 2^7 = 128, but is off by more than [1
percent](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%283%2F2%29%5E12+%2F+2%5E7).

It is an open question (at least to me!) if all of these mathematical
flaws in our tonal systems are okay because no human can perceive ~1%
out-of-tuneness they impose, or if our human ears (brains) have been
so corrupted by listening to many thousands of hours of listening to
out-of-tune imperfect music that but the time we would be knowledgable
enough to do something about it, we've lost the ability to hear these
differences (indeed, we had to lose it early, otherwise it would be
very annoying going through life thinking everything you hear is a bit
off what it should be).
