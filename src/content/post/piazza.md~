Since a few students asked about using Piazza, I wanted to post an
explanation of why I'm not willing to use Piazza in my courses here
(these are my personal views, which don't necessarily reflect those of
anyone else on the course staff).

The reason I'm not willing to use Piazza is their business model is
based on surveillance of students and monetizing the data collected
through this.  Piazza's revenue model is about selling information it
collects about students who use it to companies that might want to
hire (or not hire) them as a result of this data. The data that is
potentially collected is incredibly valuable for this purpose --- not
only does Piazza collect the names and email addresses of students, it
also leans all the classes they are in (at least for the classes using
Piazza), as well as when they work, how often they ask questions, the
contents of the questions they ask, when they answer questions, and
how often and at what times they view any course materials posted
there.
