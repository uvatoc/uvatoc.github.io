Below is the schedule for open student hours (no one is in an office
these days, but these are similar to what is sometimes called "office
hours").

These are times when there will be a course staff person available to
answer any questions you have.

During the scheduled times, the listed staff person is available to
answer your questions.

You can request help by putting a message in the `#help-requests`
channel. You will also see open help video rooms (that may have
particular topics that are being covered), and should feel free to
just jump into these rooms.

You may be wondering what the point of faculty open student hours is
with how wonderful the TAs are, and all the opportunities you have
with the cohort sessions and TA office hours.  If you are feeling
reluctant to come to faculty office hours, this video might help:

For my (Dave) office hours, I will be in the discord, but will use
[this zoom link](https://virginia.zoom.us/s/2024003839) for video
discussions (this is mainly to be able to use the waiting room to have
private discussions when desirable; if you connect to the zoom room
and are not invited in immediately, I will try to send you a message,
but you might have to wait for this to finish).  (Note: if you want to
arrange a private meeting with me at a different time, use [_https://davidevans.youcanbook.me/_](https://davidevans.youcanbook.me/).)
