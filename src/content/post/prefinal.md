As scheduled by the Registrar, the final exam will be **Thursday, 11
May, 2:00pm - 5:00pm** in our normal classroom.

The final exam will cover everything we've done in the course, but
with more emphasis on material that has been covered since the
midterm.

There is now a [Classes](/classes) page that lists all the classes to
make it easier for you to find specific content we've covered in
class.

Like the midterm, you may prepare a **one-page (letter-size,
two-sided) reference sheet for use during the exam**, but all other
resources are forbidden (no internet, textbook, other humans,
magnification instruments, etc.). We expect that students will benefit
from thinking about what to put on your reference sheet in preparing
for the exam, and you may work with anyone you want (including other
students in the class) to prepare your reference sheets together.

We have provided a practice final exam here:
[practicefinal.pdf](/docs/practicefinal.pdf)

We will be posting solutions for these problems soon, but encourage
you to try them yourself first under exam-like conditions.
