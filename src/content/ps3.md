This problem set includes problems that you will do on
``pencil-and-paper'' and writeup using the LaTeX template we provide,
and problems that involve programming that you will do using a Jupyter
notebook, a convenient way to edit and run Python code and integrate
code with formatted text.

## LaTeX Problems

To start PS1, visit the overleaf repository using this link:
[https://www.overleaf.com/read/qzzjybkydrmv](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qzzjybkydrmv). This
provides the template for you to use to provide your answers.

## Getting Started with Jupyter

Download the [`ps1.ipynb`](/ps/ps1.ipynb) file, a Jupyter notebook
which combines text (in Markdown format) and executable Python
code. You can see a [preview of this file](/ps/ps1-notebook.html)
here, but to execute it you will need to run it as a Jupyter notebook.

To execute and edit the Jupyter notebook, you will need to install
jupyter.

Visit [https://jupyter.org/](https://jupyter.org/) and follow the directions at
[https://jupyter.org/install](https://jupyter.org/install) to install jupyter on your
machine. If you already have Python installed, this should just
involve running:

````
pip install jupyterlab
````

If you don't have Python installed, you'll need to install Python
first. See [python.org](https://www.python.org/) for information on installing Python.


Once youâ€™ve installed Jupyter, run
```
jupyter notebook ps1.ipynb
```
to get started. This will start the jupyter local server and open the notebook in your web browser. 

Follow the directions there, and complete the assignment by editing this file.

### Submitting Problem Set 1

To submit problem set 1, you will need to upload your PDF from the
latex template and your Jupyter notebook as separate assignments in
GradeScope. You should submit the PDF for the "Problem Set 1"
assignment as a PDF upload, and the Jupyter file for the "Problem set
1 (programming part)" assignment.
