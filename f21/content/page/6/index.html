</div>


Goals The main goals for Week 5 are to:
 Understand what a complexity class is and how to provide properties about circuit-size complexity classes. Learn the asymptotic operators (Big-O, Ω, and Θ) and how to use them correctly. Be able to both intuitively understand what functions are in O(f(n)), and to prove membership or non-membership. Be able to connect the formal definitions of computing costs to practical questions about the cost of computing.

  </span>
  
</div>


Goals The main goals for Week 6 are to:
  Synthesize what we have learned about finite computation in the first 5 weeks, and start exploring unbounded computation.
  Appreciate the connection between functions and languages, and the different ways of talking about computation.
  Understand and be able to formally define a Finite State Automaton, and to reason about the language accepted (or function computed) by a Deterministic Finite Automaton.

</div>


Goals The main goals for Week 7 are to:
  Review and synthesize the material you learned in Weeks 1-5.
  Get some practice taking an exam without the stress and logistical challenges of a graded, in class exam.
  Schedule Monday and Tuesday are Fall Reading Days, and Tuesday is Ada Lovelace Day. There is no class meeting on Monday, October 11, and no assessed cohort meetings this week.

  </span>
  
</div>


Goals The main goals for Week 8 are to:
  Understand the proof that Regular Expressions are equivalent in power to Deterministic Finite Automata. This is a long proof, split over 4 videos, but is something we hope everyone understands in detail. The methods used in the proof are similar to ones we have seen before in showing equivalence of NAND-Circ and Boolean circuits, but is a fair bit more complex.

Goals This week, we introduce the most important and widely used model of computation, the Turing machine, and start to address the big question of what can and cannot be computed by any machine with a finite description.
The main goals for Week 9 are to:
 Understand what cannot be computed by a finite automaton and why. Use and understand Turing Machines as a model of computing. Study a definition of computability.

Wow, the final week - congratulations!
This week is different from previous weeks: there is no new technical content, and no cohort problems.
Instead, the goal of this week is for you to do something that either synthesizes a key idea from the class, or explores a topic of your choice related to theoretical computer science.
Although it will be sufficient to earn full credit this week to do something that just benefits your own understanding, we hope some of you will produce artifacts that will have value beyond this.
