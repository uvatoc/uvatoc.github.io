If you already have python3 on your machine, you should be good to go for the programming problems.
If you don’t, please follow these directions to download Python and PyCharm (you’re welcome to use any IDE that you want, we semi-arbitrarily picked PyCharm).
Windows   Install Python 3.6.4 (If you have a different version of Python, you still must install 3.6.4 seperately!):
  Download the executable x86-64 installer from python.

Purpose Your first peer evaluation is to occur after your week 4 assessed meeting (it is due with your writeup). You will evaluate all cohort-members (including yourself) on 5 items. Each item will have 4 options: exceeds expectations, meets expectations, room for improvement, unsatisfactory. The chart describes example behaviors to merit each category. Select the best fit.
Your responses will be aggregated, anonymized, and then shared with the cohort-mate whom they’re about.

Welcome to cs3102! The main goals for the first week are:
  Set up the cohorts, and have each group get to know each other and figure out how you will work well together to ensure everyone in your cohort succeeds in the course and has a good experience learning with others.
  Re-awaken the mathematical thinking skills you have (hopefully) developed previously, and start applying them to problems in theory of computing.

Goals Last week, we used a counting argument to show that there must be some uncomputable functions (&ldquo;some&rdquo; here means infinitely many), but we didin&rsquo;t find a specific uncomputable function. This week, we prove that a particular function is uncomputable, and explore the implications of finding an uncomputable function.
The main goals for Week 10 are to:
 Identify specific functions that cannot be computed by Turing Machines Develop skills for identifying uncomputable problems Build strategies for showing new problems to be uncomputable Undertand the definition of Universality in the context of Turing Machines  Schedule    Day &ldquo;Monday&rdquo; Cohort &ldquo;Tuesday&rdquo; Cohort &ldquo;Wednesday&rdquo; Cohort &ldquo;Thursday&rdquo; Cohort &ldquo;Friday&rdquo; Cohort     Wed 27 Oct Preparation (week 9) (week 9) (week 9) (week 9)   Thurs 28 Oct Preparation Preparation (week 9) (week 9) (week 9)   Fri 29 Oct Preparation Preparation Preparation (week 9) (week 9)   Sat 30 Oct Prep Cohort Meeting Preparation Preparation Preparation (week 9)   Sun 31 Oct Revision Prep Cohort Meeting Preparation Preparation Preparation   Mon 1 Nov Assessed Meeting Revision Prep Cohort Meeting Preparation Preparation   Tues 2 Nov Writeup Due Assessed Meeting Revision Prep Cohort Meeting Preparation   Wed 3 Nov (week 11) Writeup Due Assessed Meeting Revision Prep Cohort Meeting   Thurs 4 Nov (week 11) (week 11) Writeup Due Assessed Meeting Revision   Fri 5 Nov (week 11) (week 11) (week 11) Writeup Due Assessed Meeting   Sat 6 Nov (week 11) (week 11) (week 11) (week 11) Writeup Due    Cohort Problems These are the problems you should discuss in your Cohort Meeting, and everyone in your cohort should be prepared to present and discuss solutions to at the Assessed Cohort Meeting:

Goals This week, we hope you&rsquo;ll become comfortable proving functions are uncomputable (and occasionally, computable). We introduce the &ldquo;proof by reduction&rdquo; technique, which is a tremendously useful way to prove properties about problems, and (as you will see in the Algorithms class) also to develop and analyze algorithmic solutions.
The main goals for Week 11 are to:
 Become comfortable with the terms decidable, recognizable, and computable, and how we talk about these properties for languages, functions, and problems.

Goals This week we arrive at the most famous and foundational open problem in Computer Science (and, arguably, in all of Mathematics, and more questionably, perhaps of all human creative endeavor): is it substantially easier to verify the solution to a (certain very broad and common type of) problem, than it is to find that solution? (stated more formally in computer science as &ldquo;P = NP?&quot;.

Week 2: Bit Strings and Computing Models At this point you should have been assigned to a cohort and met with them at least twice (once during your assigned prep time and once during your assessed time with a TA). This week, our main goals are:
 Now that you&rsquo;ve had some cohort experience, reflect on how to make the most out of your cohort experience this semester. Begin exploration of the theory of computing, most importantly seeing the motivations for significant themes.

Week 3: Circuits and Sugar The main goals for Week 3 are to:
 Show how simple models of computing can result in complex behavior. Begin building a bridge from theoretical models of computing (like straightline programs and boolean circuits) to practical implementations of computing (like Python and integrated circuits). Explore the powers and limitations of a model of computing, including being able to understand the details of how to use that model, and why it is defined in the way chosen.

Week 4: Universal gates and Evaluation The main goals for Week 4 are to:
 Implement and use the EVAL function. This is our first exposure to a modul of computing which is able to simulate an instance of itself. This idea is fundamental to the practice of computer science, as it enables us to have arbitrarily reprogrammable machines which run with fixed hardware. Begin classifying functions by complexity (i.e. resources required to implement them).
