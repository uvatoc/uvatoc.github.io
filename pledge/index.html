        <h2 id="honor-expectations">Honor Expectations</h2>
<p>As a student at the University of Virginia, you are trusted to be
honorable and expected to behave in ways that merit that trust. We
take advantage of this trust to provide a better learning environment
for everyone. In particular, students in cs3102 are expected to follow
these rules throughout the course:</p>
<p><strong>I will not lie, cheat or steal.</strong> If I am unsure whether something
would be considered lying, cheating or stealing, I will ask before
doing it.</p>
<p><strong>I will carefully read and follow the collaboration policy on each
assignment.</strong> I will not abuse resources in ways that would be
clearly detrimental to my own learning or unfair to other
students. Viewing solutions from previous cs3102 courses is not
permitted, except when explicitly allowed.</p>
<h2 id="community-expectations">Community Expectations</h2>
<p>As a member of a learning community of students, faculty, and staff,
you are expected to exemplify these behaviors in cs3102:</p>
<p><strong>I will actively affirm the value and dignity of others and treat my
peers with decency and respect.</strong> I understand that one of the
benefits of attending the University is to be part of a vibrant
community that encompasses a wide range of backgrounds, ethnicities,
personal and family histories, and world views. I will contribute to
that community by sharing things that are unique about me with
others, fighting against any biases I may have or that I observe in
others, and being open to and respectful of people who are different
from me. I will listen to the perspectives of others, and amplify
those whose voices are not well heard.</p>
<p><strong>I will not behave in ways that harrass, intimidate, diminish, or
belittle others.</strong> If I observe such behaviors in others (including
among my classmates, the course staff, or other University faculty),
I will not tolerate them silently, but will either take it upon
myself to mitigate them, or will inform one of the course
instructors or another University administrator.</p>
<p><strong>I will care for myself physically and emotionally.</strong> Staying
stationary and working at home can make it difficult to maintain
your physical and emotional well-being. I will ensure that whatever
I am doing to succeed in my courses does not take priority over my
needs to exercise, stay hydrated, make time to eat lunch and dinner
away from your workspace, and to safely spend time outside.</p>
<p><strong>I will be connected with others, and look out of the well-being of
my classmates.</strong> Even though people are dispersed and distant, The
University of Virginia is still a community, and we hope this class,
and your learning cohort within it, will become one. Be creative in
maintaining and reinforcing that community through the struggles
caused by remoted learning and social distancing, and seek out and
maximize opportunities for virtual social interactions with fellow
students and others in the university community.</p>
<p><strong>I will ask for help.</strong> I will make a reasonable effort to do things
on my own first, and will work collaboratively with my cohort and
other classmates when permitted, but will ask the course staff for
help before getting overly frustrated. There are many ways to ask for
help including the class discord server and office hours.</p>
<p><strong>I will be open minded and curious.</strong> I understand that this course
may do things in ways differently from what I expect, and may
sometimes buck conventions that have been followed in other courses
I have taken. I will ask questions when things make me
uncomfortable, but also accept that being surprised, facing
uncertainty, and being challenged with problems it is unreasonable
to expect me to be able to solve, are often beneficial for learning
new ways of thinking.</p>
<p><strong>I grant the course staff permission to reproduce excerpts from my
submissions for teaching purposes.</strong> My work will be attributed when
it is shown in a postive way, but may be used anonymously if it is
used to illustrate common pitfalls or other issues.</p>
<p><strong>I will provide useful feedback.</strong> I realize that this will be
attempting many new things, and that the cohort model being used
this semester has not been tried previously. It is important that I
let the course staff know what they need to improve the course. I
will provide feedback either anonymously or by contacting the course
staff directly. I will fill out all requested surveys honestly and
thoroughly.</p>
