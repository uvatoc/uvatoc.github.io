      <description>Honor Expectations As a student at the University of Virginia, you are trusted to be honorable and expected to behave in ways that merit that trust. We take advantage of this trust to provide a better learning environment for everyone. In particular, students in cs3120 are expected to follow these rules throughout the course:
I will not lie, cheat or steal. If I am unsure whether something would be considered lying, cheating or stealing, I will ask before doing it.</description>

      <description>Theory of Computation (renumbered as cs3120, but very similar to the course previously numbered as cs3102) will be offered in Spring 2023, co-taught by Mohammad Mahmoody and David Evans.
Class meetings will be Tuesdays and Thursdays, 9:30 – 10:45am in Olsson Hall 120.
We&amp;rsquo;ll be putting more information here about the course as the start of the semester approaches.
For now, you can see what the course was like in previous semesters from Prof.</description>

      <description>If you already have python3 on your machine, you should be good to go for the programming problems.
If you don’t, please follow these directions to download Python and PyCharm (you’re welcome to use any IDE that you want, we semi-arbitrarily picked PyCharm).
Windows   Install Python 3.6.4 (If you have a different version of Python, you still must install 3.6.4 seperately!):
