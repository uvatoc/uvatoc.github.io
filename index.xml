      <description>You can find instructor and TA office hours in the calendar below. Some office hours are held remotely, others in person, some both simultaneously. Make sure you check the location in the calendar.
Regardless of where the office hours are held, #help-requests channel in discord will be used as our office hours queue. To add yourself to the queue, simply post what you&amp;rsquo;re asking about (e.g. &amp;ldquo;week1 pancakes video&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;week 1 problem 5&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;countability&amp;rdquo;) and where you&amp;rsquo;re joining from (online versus in-person if there are multiple options at the same time).</description>

      <description>Honor Expectations As a student at the University of Virginia, you are trusted to be honorable and expected to behave in ways that merit that trust. We take advantage of this trust to provide a better learning environment for everyone. In particular, students in cs3102 are expected to follow these rules throughout the course:
I will not lie, cheat or steal. If I am unsure whether something would be considered lying, cheating or stealing, I will ask before doing it.</description>

      <description>First Class Meeting Our first scheduled class is Wednesday, 25 August, 3:30-4:45pm in Maury Hall 209 (weather permitting, we will also use the Ampitheater space outside Maury).
For this optional first class meeting, we will have an open &amp;ldquo;meet and greet&amp;rdquo; with an opportunity to ask any questions you would like of the course instructors, and an opportunity for students who wish to form their own cohorts (details below) to do so.</description>

      <description>Overview Course Description: The goal of this course is to understand the fundamental limits on what can be efficiently computed in our universe and other possible (or imaginary) universes. These limits reveal deep and mysterious properties about information, communication, and computing, as well as practical issues about how to solve problems.
Two fundamental questions about any problem are:
 Can it be solved using a machine of a certain type?</description>

      <description>[Updated 18 August 2021]
The cs3102 course will be offered in Fall 2021, co-taught by Nathan&amp;nbsp;Brunelle and David&amp;nbsp;Evans.
Class meetings will be Mondays and Wednesday, 3:30pm - 4:45pm in Maury Hall 209. We will be sending out an email next week with details on the in-person class meetings, but they are being planned in a way that prioritizes safety and comfort while offering an in-person class experience.
We&amp;rsquo;ll be putting more information here about the course as the start of the semester approaches.</description>

      <description>If you already have python3 on your machine, you should be good to go for the programming problems.
If you don’t, please follow these directions to download Python and PyCharm (you’re welcome to use any IDE that you want, we semi-arbitrarily picked PyCharm).
Windows  Install Python 3.6.4 (If you have a different version of Python, you still must install 3.6.4 seperately!):
 Download the executable x86-64 installer from python.</description>

      <description>Welcome to cs3102! The main goals for the first week are:
 Set up the cohorts, and have each group get to know each other and figure out how you will work well together to ensure everyone in your cohort succeeds in the course and has a good experience learning with others.
 Re-awaken the mathematical thinking skills you have (hopefully) developed previously, and start applying them to problems in theory of computing.</description>

      <description>Week 2: Bit Strings and Computing Models At this point you should have been assigned to a cohort and met with them at least twice (once during your assigned prep time and once during your assessed time with a TA). This week, our main goals are:
 Now that you&amp;rsquo;ve had some cohort experience, reflect on how to make the most out of your cohort experience this semester. Begin exploration of the theory of computing, most importantly seeing the motivations for significant themes.</description>
