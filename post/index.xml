      <description>Theory of Computation (renumbered as cs3120, but very similar to the course previously numbered as cs3102) will be offered in Spring 2023, co-taught by Mohammad Mahmoody and David Evans.
Class meetings will be Tuesdays and Thursdays, 9:30 – 10:45am in Olsson Hall 120.
We&amp;rsquo;ll be putting more information here about the course as the start of the semester approaches.
For now, you can see what the course was like in previous semesters from Prof.</description>
