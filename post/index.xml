      <description>Problem Set 4 is now posted and due on Monday, 20 February (9:59pm).
This problem set focuses on understanding the asymptotic notations, syntactic sugar (Chapter 4), and the circuit complexity and the size hierarchy theorem (Chapter 5 of TCS).
The latex template for Problem Set 4 is here: https://overleaf.com/read/hsxfrxnsvyfw (there is no Jupyter notebook part of this problem set).
The problems PDF is: ps4.pdf.</description>

Problem Set 3 (Overleaf, Jupyter) is due Monday, 13 February, 9:59pm.
As was pointed out to me by an intrepid student after class, what I said about { OR, NOT } being not universal since we included AND in our AON Circuits is badly wrong! One easy way to see this is we know we can convert between { AND, NOT } and { OR, NOT } using De Morgan&amp;rsquo;s laws, so we can construct AND from { OR, NOT }.</description>

      <description>As discussed in Class 5, there was a problem on Quiz 2 that both the professors got wrong probably more than once.
Although it was meant to be a fairly straightforward multiple choice question, it illustrates how tricky it is to think about the subtleties of simple definitions on binary relations and the importance of precise definitions.
The question, as asked on Quiz 2 is below:

      <description>Here are my (Dave) answers to questions from the course registration survey. If you have new questions that weren&amp;rsquo;t answered, or want to follow-up on anything, please feel free to do so either in office hours, on Discord, or by email.
 Do you two have a passion for computer science or a specific topic within computer science, why is that? What do you think about you or your past primed you to develop this interest?</description>

      <description>Theory of Computation (renumbered as cs3120, but very similar to the course previously numbered as cs3102) will be offered in Spring 2023, co-taught by Mohammad Mahmoody and David Evans.
Class meetings will be Tuesdays and Thursdays, 9:30 – 10:45am in Olsson Hall 120.
We&amp;rsquo;ll be putting more information here about the course as the start of the semester approaches.
For now, you can see what the course was like in previous semesters from Prof.</description>
