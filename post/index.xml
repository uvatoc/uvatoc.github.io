Some solutions and hints on the practice final are here: practicefinal-comments.pdf. (If there are questions about problems with incomplete solutions, we might add to this later.)
We won&amp;rsquo;t have the regular office hours schedule now that the end of classes has passed, but still have many office hours scheduled until the final exam on May 11.

      <description>As scheduled by the Registrar, the final exam will be Thursday, 11 May, 2:00pm - 5:00pm in our normal classroom.
The final exam will cover everything we&amp;rsquo;ve done in the course, but with more emphasis on material that has been covered since the midterm.
There is now a Classes page that lists all the classes to make it easier for you to find specific content we&amp;rsquo;ve covered in class.
Like the midterm, you may prepare a one-page (letter-size, two-sided) reference sheet for use during the exam, but all other resources are forbidden (no internet, textbook, other humans, magnification instruments, etc.</description>

Here are the links to the Turing Machine simulations:
4-state Busy Beaver candidate
5-state Busy Beaver candidate
As mentioned in class, there are lots of different ways to define a Turing Machine, and no agreed upon standard definition. None of the small changes to the definition impact the set of functions that can be computed (as we will see in upcoming classes), but they do impact how hard it might be to write programs and prove properties about Turing Machines.</description>

Problem Set 3 (Overleaf, Jupyter) is due Monday, 13 February, 9:59pm.
As was pointed out to me by an intrepid student after class, what I said about { OR, NOT } being not universal since we included AND in our AON Circuits is badly wrong! One easy way to see this is we know we can convert between { AND, NOT } and { OR, NOT } using De Morgan&amp;rsquo;s laws, so we can construct AND from { OR, NOT }.</description>

      <description>As discussed in Class 5, there was a problem on Quiz 2 that both the professors got wrong probably more than once.
Although it was meant to be a fairly straightforward multiple choice question, it illustrates how tricky it is to think about the subtleties of simple definitions on binary relations and the importance of precise definitions.
The question, as asked on Quiz 2 is below:
